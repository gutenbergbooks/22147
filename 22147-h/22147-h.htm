<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Original material for a biography of Peter the
Hermit either does not exist in this country, or, if
here, does not yield itself readily to knowledge
and use. The "Life of Peter the Hermit," by
D'Outremant, and another by Andr&eacute; Thevet, on
which Michaud draws heavily, seem beyond reach,
as are also the histories of the Crusades, by von
Raumer and Maunbourg.</p>

<p>On examining a number of English and American
"Histories of the Crusades," I found them to
be largely abridgments or paraphrases of
Michaud's monumental work.</p>

<p>It is, then, from Michaud and Milman chiefly
that the writer has drawn the facts herein recorded,
having often found it necessary to chasten the too
pronounced Roman sympathies of Michaud by the
equally pronounced Protestantism of Milman. To
<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>these authors I am so much indebted as to call for
the fullest acknowledgment. The Rev. Dr. J. A.
Faulkner, Professor in Drew Theological Seminary,
has put me under great obligations by permitting
me to use Hagenmeyer's "Life of Peter," especially
valuable to the early and late parts of Peter's life.</p>

<h3>PETER THE HERMIT.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Foreground.</span></p>


<p>The great movements called the Crusades followed
the leading of universal religious instincts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Cause
of Pilgrimages</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Belong to
all Religions</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Impulse
of
To-day.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pilgrimages
and
Historic
Memory</i></div>

<p>Wherever a great leader has been born, has
taught, has suffered, died, or been buried, the feet
of his followers have been glad to stand. At such
spots religious emotions are revived, holy influences
are believed to be absorbed, and a sense of nearness
to the prophets of God acquired. Whatever the
teacher wore, used, or even looked upon, became
a treasure through its relation to him. In India
pilgrimages to holy shrines, rivers, and cities have
been works of merit, even from prehistoric times.
The same is true of China as to temples, tombs,
springs, and mountain summits. Devotees of later<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
religions, like that of Mahomet, have their Meccas,
as the Roman Church has her Loretto and her
Lourdes. The murder of Thomas &aacute; Becket was
followed by the Canterbury pilgrimages, immortalized
by Chaucer. "From the lowest Fetichism
up to Christianity itself this general and unconquerable
propensity has either been sanctioned by
religion or sprung up out of it."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Humanity leans
more readily on the Incarnate Savior than on Him
who was "before the world was." To-day the devout
Christian feels the impulse to walk where the
Master walked, to behold the sea which He stilled,
to sit by the well where He preached, to pray in
the garden of His agony, and to stand on the summit
above which He shone. And if his faith can
be assured as to the site of Calvary, the great
tragedy loses all historical dimness and is made
real, visible, and present, though its story be read
through penitent tears. The place suggests the
man; the man suggests the Divine Man; He seems
nearer when we worship where an apostle said, "My
Lord and my God."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The East
the Fountain
of Religions</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Influence
of Magna
Gr&aelig;cia</i></div>

<p>The East has always been the fountain of religions
to the European mind. To the westward
flowed the stream of doctrines which sprang up in<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the Orient. We are beginning to see that Greece
came to many of her gods through instruction from
the Asiatic continent, and that her originality in
religion lay chiefly in her refinement of nature worship
and in the beautiful marble forms in which
Greek genius enshrined her divinities. From
Greece the stream reached Italy in Magna Gr&aelig;cia,
and later by the adoption through Roman assimilation
of the gods of the Greek Pantheon. The
worship of Isis and Osiris came from Egypt to
Rome, and became an influential cult there, as witness
the abounding symbols of that worship still
preserved in the Capitoline Museum.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Charm
of Judea to
Christians</i></div>

<p>To the Christian no land could be so full of religious
suggestions, remembrances, and associations
as Judea. France, Spain, Italy, Britain were no
sooner Christianized in any degree than pilgrims
began to set out for the Jordan, for Bethlehem, for
Jerusalem with its Gethsemane, its Calvary, and
its Holy Sepulcher. Those who were taught that
blessing came "by the work wrought," especially
when the years prophesied a brief space of life left,
eagerly sought to wash sin away in Jordan or to
die near the hill of the atonement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greater
Number of
Pilgrims</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Buildings by
Constantine
and Helena</i></div>

<p>When Christianity became imperial by alliance
with the State, and corrupt by the ascendency of<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Constantine in its Councils, the number of pilgrims
greatly increased. Ambitions as well as devotions
drew men to Palestine. Constantine had evoked
Jerusalem again as a name and as a city from the
ruins of the preceding three centuries. The liberality
of Constantine and Helena had identified
the holy places sufficiently for the credulous faith
of the time, and has decorated them with churches
and colonnades. Michaud says: "An obscure cavern
had become a marble temple paved with precious
stones. To the east of the Holy Sepulcher
appeared the Church of the Resurrection, where
the riches of Asia mingled with the arts of Greece
and Rome."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Security in
Pilgrimages</i></div>

<p>The attraction of such buildings, however, was
not so great a stimulus to pilgrimages as the security
which the pilgrim might have, both on his
journey and after his arrival, through the extended
and effective authority of the Roman emperor. The
pilgrim could now journey without fighting his
way, could be housed without secrecy after his arrival,
and could worship without stripes at any one
of the many shrines which attracted his piety.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dangers of
the Earlier
Journeys</i></div>

<p>It is doubtful if any pilgrims traveled so far at
first in such numbers through unsympathetic and
unfriendly people as those who went as palmers<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
before the settlement of the roads by Constantine
or just before the Crusades. During the stay of
St. Jerome at Bethlehem, in the fourth century,
the pilgrims were so numerous that he speaks of
them as coming in crowds, and says that the praises
of God could be heard there in many languages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Early
Fathers
and their
Cautions</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Warnings of
St. Jerome</i></div>

<p>Some of the great leaders of the Church,
Jerome himself with varying note, were wise
enough to point out the evils of these pilgrimages,
and to remind the faithful that the Christ might
be honored by good deeds at home. Gregory of
Nyssa wrote: "The Lord has not said, 'Go to the
Orient and seek justice.' Travel even to the west
and you shall receive pardon." St. Augustine said in
the first sermon on the words of the Apostle Peter:
"I am unwilling to consider a long journey. Where
you believe, there you arrive."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Jerome from Bethlehem
itself writes, "Heaven is equally open to
Britain and Jerusalem." He could not have advised
against pilgrimages more strenuously if he
had wished to keep Bethlehem for himself and for
the Roman ladies drawn thither by his example.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Good Roads
and Travelers'
Homes</i></div>

<p>For several centuries the passion for the pilgrimage
increased steadily. Roads were indicated,
resting places pointed out, and wealth sought to<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
buy salvation by building hospitals and providing
for doles of bread and wine to those who made the
sacred journey. Charlemagne made their case a
tax on his subjects through whose bounds they
passed. "Even in our entire kingdom neither rich
nor poor shall dare to deny hospitality to the pilgrims....
On account of the love of God
and the salvation of our souls, no one shall deny
them shelter, fire, or water."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Shelters in
Jerusalem</i></div>

<p>In Jerusalem vast caravanseries were built for
them, Gregory the Great building there one of the
largest of all shelters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Washing
Sins Away</i></div>

<p>The signs of the pilgrim&mdash;the staff, the wallet,
and the scallop-shell&mdash;were blessed by priest or
bishop before departure, and took on added sanctity,
and even miracle-working power, if they had
reached actual use in the Holy Land. It was not
long before an indulgent Church guaranteed that
bathing in Jordan should wash away all sin. And,
as the Holy Land must be rich in the bones of
martyrs and in the relics of Christ and His apostles,
it was within the ambition of the pilgrims to possess
a hair of the Virgin, a thread from the seamless coat,
a nail which had pierced His hand, a splinter from
the cross, or a thorn which had torn His brow. All
these were believed to possess powers of healing,<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and their possession permanently increased the dignity
of families and the wealth of Churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Relics and
Miracles</i></div>

<p>The demand for such relics from the Christian
world was great and the supply was greater. Traffic
in these was enriched by the purchase of the
silks, spices, and other treasures of the East, and
commercial greed came to move men under the
cover of the cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Chosroes
Conquers
Syria</i></div>

<p>The stream of pilgrimage was full until the
reign of Heraclius. Then the Persian king, Chosroes,
carried his arms through Syria and Palestine
to Egypt. The fire-worshipers defiled the holy
city by their authority and their worship. They
tainted and robbed the churches, and carried off
what was believed to be the cross of the crucifixion,
which had been guarded by the Church of the
Resurrection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Return of
the Cross</i></div>

<p>The wailing of the Christian world over this
loss strengthened the courage of Heraclius through
ten years of reverses, and aided in the late but full
victory which not only brought back to Jerusalem
the enslaved Christians but the Cross of Calvary, as
the most glorious of trophies. The emperor himself
bore this barefooted to the summit of Calvary, and
at Constantinople received the congratulations of
the Christian world.<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerusalem was soon, however, to feel the weight
of a new and heavy hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rise of
Mahomet</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greek
Empire
Corrupt</i></div>

<p>In Arabia a religion arose with a singular power
of advance, which it retains to this day. The union
of the spiritual with the material, of the sensual
with a fatalistic theology, made the followers of
Mahomet eager for heaven by way of the battle-field.
The Jews had now no unity; Christianity had
become divided into sects cursing each other; the
Persian Empire had exhausted itself; the Greek
Empire was wasted with its own corruptions. The
way was open for the stern, sober, and, in all respects
but one, self-denying followers of Mahomet.
Until they learned to navigate they swept the eastern
and southern coasts of the Mediterranean. They
early overwhelmed Palestine. Becoming masters
of maritime peoples, they conquered even to Spain;
were held at bay for a while by Constantinople;
came even under the walls of Vienna, and were at
length beaten back by Charles Martel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jerusalem
Sacred to
Mohammedans</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jerusalem
Taken by
Omar</i></div>

<p>Jerusalem was almost as sacred a city to the
Mohammedans as to the Christians. Their prophet
had visited it, and had journeyed to heaven from
it. Attacked by the soldiers of Omar shortly after
the death of the prophet, the Christians endured the
horrors of a siege for four months, resisting armies<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
which claimed the city as theirs by the promises of
God. Omar came to receive the keys of the exhausted
city, and Christians cried out in agony as
the chief infidel defiled by his presence the Holy
Sepulcher. They were permitted to worship, but
not openly to exhibit their crosses and sacred books.
Their conqueror erected a mosque on the site of
the temple. This was more than the breaking heart
of the Christian patriarch could bear. He died bewailing
the sorrows and desolation of the city of the
Great King.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Omar
Checks
Persecution</i></div>

<p>While Omar lived the hand of persecution was
in good measure stayed, but worked in full vigor
as soon as he was dead. Christians were certain
neither of their homes nor of their churches. Their
taxes were increased to the point of exhaustion.
They could not mount a horse nor bear a weapon. A
leather girdle must always show their subjection.
No Arabic word must fall from their lips, nor could
they speak the name of their own Patriarch without
permission.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hardships
Stimulate
Pilgrimages</i></div>

<p>These hardships awakened the sympathy of the
Christian world, and stimulated many to go to the
Holy Land that they then might be "accounted
worthy to suffer with Christ."</p>

<p>Arculphus and Antoninus, of Plaisance,<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
reached sainthood by making this journey and certifying
to the Western Churches the persecutions
of the Christians in the Holy Land.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Haroun al
Raschid
Just</i></div>

<p>Yet truth compels the statement that the Mohammedans
were not always unjust or unkind. Intervals
of peace came to cheer those who wept, and
the reign of Haroun al Raschid offered them the
largest hope. The great Charles was now great
enough, even in Eastern eyes, to secure liberty and
peace to Christians in far-off Palestine, and was
treated as an equal through embassies and presents
by the great Caliph.</p>

<p>Never could a monarch have received a more
welcome present than did Charlemagne when the
Caliph sent him the keys of the Holy Sepulcher.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christ
Expected
1000 A. D.</i></div>

<p>It is also to be remembered that prophecy had
been interpreted to mean that in the year 1000 A. D.
Christ would appear and set up His millennial kingdom.
This greatly stimulated the pilgrimages to the
Holy Land, as it did all other phases of devotion.
Thousands felt that it would be well to be at the
scene of the cross and of the resurrection when
Christ came with His angels. It were well they
should be near where He ascended, whether they
were living or dead when He came.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Haroun
Dead
Persecution
Follows</i></div>

<p>Persecutions followed the death of the great<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Caliph, particularly in the sultanate of Egypt. The
Church of the Holy Sepulcher was destroyed.
Other Christian buildings shared the same fate.
Then as now, the Jews had to suffer from suspicions
created by their voluntary segregation as well
as by their forced isolation. The Christians in
France heard that the French Jews had sent word
to the Sultan Hakim that a great Christian invasion
of the Holy Land was intended. This led to a
revenge, the justice of which in any degree remains
unsettled to this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Toll for
Entering
Jerusalem</i></div>

<p>Unexpected calm came to Palestine through the
development of the maritime powers of Italy, which
could fall on Hakim's dominions at will. The largest
annoyance of the pilgrims for awhile was the
enforced payment of a toll for entering Jerusalem,
established near this time by the Mohammedan
powers. In the cooler blood of historical inquiry
to-day, we can not wonder at a tax which failed at
its greatest height to meet the increased cost of
government when thousands of pilgrims were added
to the population of Jerusalem and its environs.
But it was often gladly paid by those who could,
and the gates of Jerusalem were opened by the
richer pilgrims for those to whom it was an impossible
or severe burden.<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christianity
now
Wealthy</i></div>

<p>Christianity had now attained a history of a
thousand years. It had climbed to stately thrones
and to cathedrals. Princes of great names, like
Robert of Normandy, and bishops who were also
secular princes made the pilgrimage and returned
to speak with authority on the attractions of the
holy places and on the shame of the infidel's domination.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pilgrimage
Guaranteed
Pardon</i></div>

<p>In the shrewd management of the Church at this
time, pilgrimages were substituted for penances,
and troublesome sinners were sent out of their country
on a pious mission which promised forgiveness
if it could not pledge reform. It at least secured a
period of quiet to their families and of security to
the neighborhoods from which they came.</p>

<p>The Bollandist manuscripts afford many details
of the pilgrim life at Jerusalem which had, however,
to be enjoyed by permission of the infidel, always
a bitter portion in the pilgrim's cup.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Round of
Pilgrim
Duties</i></div>

<p>On arrival they prepared themselves by fasting
and prayer. Then, covered by a mourning robe,
they visited the Church of the Sepulcher. The robe
thus attained such sanctity that it was preserved
until death and enshrouded the owner at burial.
They then visited, in turn, the sacred spots in and
adjacent to the city. This accomplished, they<!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
sought the holy mountains of the Sermon, the
Transfiguration, and Ascension. Then they washed
their sins away in Jordan, and tore off palm-leaves
near Jericho to attest on their homeward journey
that the holy pilgrimage was complete.</p>

<p>The tenth and eleventh centuries thus kept by
the thousands of pilgrims yearly, all Christian
Europe became informed of the conditions which
obtained in the land where Christ suffered for the
sins of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Services
to Pilgrims</i></div>

<p>Slowly there grew up a devotion which was
nearly equal to a secondary religion. Service rendered
to a pilgrim was almost the same as being a
pilgrim. Nor did the pilgrims fail to profit by the
reverence they inspired. Some of them paid their
way by their prayers. There is record of one who
paid his fare for a voyage from Alexandria to Palestine
with a copy of the Evangelists.</p>

<p>On the St. Bernard, on Mt. Cenis, on the frontiers
of Hungary, in Asia Minor, as well as in Palestine,
hospitals and hostelries were built by the
faithful as works of salvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Impure
Accretions</i></div>

<p>No pious movement has ever long existed without
drawing to itself some of impure and selfish
motive. The rich had no surer way of advertising
their generosity than by making the journey and<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
aiding in the comfort of their poorer brethren.
Some made the pilgrimage as many times as planet
pilgrims now visit Europe. Yet to the credit of the
pilgrim it must be said that no act of violence is
recorded against any one who really made the whole
journey. It is recorded of a Mussulman governor
that he said of such, "They are not away from home
with bad intent, but to keep their law."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Confusion
of Moral
Sense</i></div>

<p>Confusing to the moral sense as we possess it,
and destructive of true morality as we must hold it
to be, we must further admit with astonishment that
pilgrimage was held to be a cure for the most dreadful
sin.</p>

<p>A Brittany lord who murdered his brother and
his uncle was ordered to make the journey twice
with humiliating conditions, and returned, after
three years on Mount Sinai, to be received as a saint
and to dignify a monastery by his narrations and
his residence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Journey
Condones
Murder</i></div>

<p>One journey was enough to free from further
penalty a Roman prefect who had dragged a pope
from his altar. Foulque-Nerra, Count of Anjou,
pursued by the ghosts of those he had murdered,
sought to quiet them through three unavailing
journeys.</p>

<p>For such reasons and for many others, some of<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
which can hardly be brought within religious motives,
thousands made the journey. Three thousand,
beginning with the Bishop of Cambrai, were
nearly all starved or murdered in Bulgaria, and
the few who went on as far as Laodicea turned
back or died there, while their leader went back to
his diocese.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bloody
Welcome in
Bulgaria</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Three
Thousand
Killed</i></div>

<p>One more band, or army rather, of ten thousand
started ten years later with the Archbishop of Mayence
and the Bishops of Spires, Cologne, Bamberg,
and Utrecht. They were almost in sight of Jerusalem
when the Bedouins besieged and captured them.
Saved from death by a neighboring Emir, they followed
the news of their tribulations to Jerusalem,
where they were received with joy. They lost during
the whole journey three thousand of their number,
and went back to fire Europe with accounts of
their impressions, their perils, and their undeserved
dangers.</p>

<p>As the tolerance of the earlier caliphs was succeeded
by the fanaticism of the Turks, the Christians
of Jerusalem ceased to be treated with any
other consideration than that accorded to despised
slaves. Pilgrims were no longer guests, but intruders.
No persecution, however, stopped the flow
of pilgrims. The harder the way, the greater the<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
cost, the greater the merit. The pilgrim might, under
these later conditions, easily become a martyr.
The martyr's crown was sure, by the faith of the
times, to become a heavenly crown. Few now survived
the journey. These often came back starved,
cut, and mutilated. Their appearance and the great
gaps in the ranks of those who returned, kindled a
smoldering fire under all Europe. Such had been
the pre-eminence of Constantinople and the Greek
Empire that if the Greeks had retained their former
quality, the Turks might have been driven back by
those who sat on that famous throne. But when the
corruption of decay was attacked by the vigor of an
almost savage state, there could be but one result.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greeks
Truculent</i></div>

<p>Among the Greeks the lowest qualities and the
basest acts found justification under the name of
policy. Courage in battle was supplanted by the
shield and mechanism of bodily safety. They
killed the men who tried to rouse them. They had
wasted all their inheritance but great memories, and
had acquired a truculent and factious spirit. While
they were nearing the utter decay of their influence
the infant West was found to have grown until all
that was noble in character and all that was true in
Christianity, all which could respond in courage and
self-sacrifice to the call of Jerusalem for deliverance,<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
was to be found among those whom the Greeks
had held to be Barbarians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Papal
Ambition</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Greatness
of Gregory</div>

<p>The Roman Curia, from its first date of political
influence, had never ceased to enhance its authority
by the use of the secular arm when it had none of
its own, or by its own secular arm when it could
command one. The disturbed conditions in the
East, together with the decay of Greek influence and
the cowardice and helplessness of the Byzantine
emperors, had led Michael Ducas to appeal to Pope
Gregory for help. The prize offered Gregory was
the submission of the Greek to the Roman Church
and the removal of all barriers. From the standpoint
of ability, Gregory well deserves the title
"Great." He seems as great in statecraft as in
executive ability. The hope of being a universal pope
led him to promise aid. He urged the faithful to
take up arms against the Mussulmans, and promised
to lead them himself. His letters were full of
the loftiest ideas. Fifty thousand agreed to follow
his lead. But he found the management of
Europe more to his taste and perhaps to his need.</p>

<p>The decay of Byzantine power was wisely used
for the development of pontifical authority and
the spread of the Latin Church. And, again, the
Eternal City through its popes, and particularly<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
through Gregory, became the ruler of the world.
Gregory summoned all monarchs to derive their
authority and their enthronement from him, and endeavored
to make laws for every country in which
his Church had place. Resisted by some monarchs,
his influence widened nevertheless, and while he
forgot his pledge to deliver Jerusalem, he prepared
the way for a final unity of action which he could
not secure in his own lifetime.</p>

<p>In the pontificate of his successor, mingled religious
and commercial motives led to a movement
against the Saracens, which, while never numbered
among the Crusades, almost deserved that name.
The acquisition of maritime power by the Saracens
had led to interference with Italian commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>"Christian"

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE MAN AND HIS MESSAGE.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Preparation
for Peter</i></div>

<p>The study of the Foreground of the Crusades
exhibits the preparation for the man who was to
be the great leader and, one might say, originator
of these astonishing movements. Whatever part
others played, or whatever the measure of the aid
given, to Peter the Hermit is to be given the credit
of the effective inspiration and active leadership.</p>

<p>The leadership here claimed for Peter is challenged,
it is only fair to say, by Von Sybil whose
views are, in the main, accepted by Hagenmeyer.
Von Sybil gives credit to the Pope alone for inspiration
and direction. It seems more probable,
however, that the Pope utilized and magnified the
enthusiasm and influence of Peter; and directed it
into channels more likely to permit the movement
of the Roman Church Eastward and the growth
of Pontifical supremacy. This is the view contained
in these pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Birth</i></div>

<p>We know where Peter came from. Born in
Picardy, the historians are not agreed whether of<!-- Page 26 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
obscure or noble family. It makes little difference,
since if this were known all their dignity and life
in history would proceed from Peter. He was
called Peter the Hermit because he was a hermit,
and not, as some have maintained, because it was
his surname. The weight of opinion favors his
descent from humble parents.</p>

<p>All are agreed that he was of very ordinary appearance;
one says "ignoble and vulgar." The sum
of the statements of contemporaries as to his personality,
is that he was of sharp understanding,
energetic, decided; coarse and sometimes brutal;
enthusiastic; of great imaginative power. If a
Picard, then a Frank, and if a Frank, then a fighter,
and very ready to fight for religion. His nationality,
therefore, gave him access by speech to a most restless,
gallant, and adventurous people. Born with
courage, moral intensity, restlessness, and activity,
he experimented for satisfaction in every direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Chooses
Hermit's
Life</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Effect of
Self-confidence</i></div>

<p>It seems that neither celibacy nor marriage,
study nor warfare, long attracted him. The conditions
about him seemed beyond his remedy, and,
like many others, he retired from a sinful world to
the harshnesses and austerity of a hermit's life.
Fasting did for him what it seems to do for all
when excess is reached either by self-will or neces<!-- Page 27 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>sity.
He became truly a "visionary." "He saw
visions and dreamed dreams." His temperament
and his religious exercises made him feel that, better
than others he knew the will of God and that
he was chosen to execute it. In this stage a man
becomes capable of great things in a poor cause.
The world is always impressed by the confident and
the courageous. No great movement, however
wrong in doctrine, defective in morals, or disastrous
in results, has been without such leadership.</p>

<p>Like all orators of the Latin race, his fervor
showed itself, not only in his tones, but in his gesticulation
and his postures. He was a master of
pantomime. If any were beyond his voice, they
were not beyond his meaning. If he had lived in
our time he would have been counted among the
most "magnetic" of preachers. The reputation of
his sanctity showered him with gifts. He kept
nothing for himself. All went to the poor, and
evil women were dowried by him that they might
cease from evil in honorable marriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Generosity
Self-Sacrifice</i></div>

<p>Peter was not stirred alone by the relations of
returning pilgrims as to the ignominies heaped alike
on the sacred places and on the religious by the
Turks. He followed in the wake of the devotees
who traversed the long road to the Holy City. That<!-- Page 28 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Peter actually made this journey is sufficiently attested
by his contemporary, Anna Conmena. She
probably met him while tarrying in Constantinople,
and could easily know of his presence at the palace
of her father, Alexius. From her we learn that he
had to flee before the Turks and Saracens, and
her narration makes it doubtful if he reached Jerusalem
on his first attempt. By so much as he was
more enthusiastic than others by nature, by so
much was he fired with indignation, which to him
was but the just expression of his zeal and his piety.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Emotions in
Jerusalem</i></div>

<p>He stood with agony on Calvary. He adored
with tears the tomb of Christ. Then he sought
speech with the Patriarch of Jerusalem. His name
was Simeon, and like another, waited for "the salvation
of God." Who is responsible for the report
of this interview we do not know, but one more
probable and pathetic is not on record outside the
Bible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Patriarch
Simeon</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Simeon's
and Peter's
Hope</i></div>

<p>Simeon had suffered much for his faith as well
as for his leadership. The impatient enthusiasm of
Peter was moved to tears by the patient enthusiasm
of Simeon. "Is there no remedy?" cried Peter,
weeping. And Simeon answered: "Is it not evident
that our sins have shut us away from the mercy
of the Lord? All Asia is in the power of the Mus<!-- Page 29 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>sulmans;
all the East is enslaved; no power on
earth can help us." Peter asked, "May not the
warriors of the West come to your help?" "Yes,"
said Simeon, "when our cup is full, God will soften
the princes of the West, and will send them to the
help of the Holy City." This was Peter's thought,
and, weeping with joy over a great hope, the patriarch
and the pilgrim embraced. The patriarch
pledged himself to appeal to Europe by letter and
Peter by word of mouth.</p>

<p>The plan of Peter was strengthened by his further
devotions at the Holy Sepulcher. There are
two ways in which men of strong will become sure
that their will is the will of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Mental
Constitution</i></div>

<p>One is to make a plan, and then submit it to God
in prayer. The other, and the truer, is to ask God's
help in the making of the plan as in its execution.
The first, as was probable from Peter's intellectual
and moral constitution, seems to have been the way
in which he came to certainty as to his life mission.
There is no reason to doubt that in his exiled
state, moved at once by piety and peril, he saw the
vision, though inwardly, which inspired his return.
At the Sepulcher he thought he heard the voice of
Christ commanding him to proclaim the sorrows of
Christ's land and of Christ's people. The best ac<!-- Page 30 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>count
of this vision and commission is that of the
Historia Belli Sacri: "One evening as Peter went
to rest the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him in a
vision, saying, 'Peter, stand up. Go back quickly
into the West. Betake thyself to Pope Urban with
this commission from Me that he get all My
brothers as quickly as possible to hasten to Jerusalem,
in order to purge the city of unbelievers.
All who do this from love to Me, to them stand
open the doors of the kingdom of heaven.'" This
became to him a daily commission from on high.
Bearing letters from Simeon, he went to Italy by
sea, and sought the presence and aid of Urban II,
then pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pope
Urban</i></div>

<p>Urban felt that this call, recognized by his predecessors,
was more fully and loudly given to him.</p>

<p>The refusal of Hagenmeyer to credit this vision
and its influence on Pope Urban seems to be the
result of an ultra critical spirit. When a pope
speaks, after argument and urging, he is not likely
to think it consonant with his dignity to give credit
in allocution or bull to those who urged him.
Holding that all men are properly servants of the
Holy See, he speaks as if he was the original
source of knowledge and impulse. Urban does not,
in his famous speech at the Council of Clermont,<!-- Page 31 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
give Peter's vision or Peter's urgency as a ground
for his utterance or action. But he followed Peter
on that occasion, and it may well be that if Peter
mentioned his vision as the inspiration of his mission,
the pope would not speak of its influence on
himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Urban's
Emotions</i></div>

<p>The Roman pontiffs, whatever their own ability
or lack of it, have always been distinguished for the
wise use of enthusiasm. If not able to make the
wise direction of it themselves, some one of the
Curia has always been at their service to value the
force and direct it into channels of wider influence
for the Church. There can be little doubt that
Urban was moved by a true and generous feeling.
It would have been almost impossible for any one
to have simulated the grief he manifested at the
Council of Clermont.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mixed
Motives</i></div>

<p>But there can be as little doubt that, as the proposed
movement must inevitably aggrandize Roman
Catholicity and make her the leader of the Christian
world, Urban was happier and stronger by the
coincidence and collaboration of both forces. There
was a rival pope, and there were sovereigns who
were his enemies. What a God-given opportunity
to humble the Antipope and bring the unfriendly
kings to his feet!<!-- Page 32 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Garb</i></div>

<p>The pope gave Peter his commission and sent
him forth with his blessing. Mounting a mule,
which soon attained in the thought of the people
something of its master's sanctity, he passed through
Italy, crossed the Alps, was in every part of France,
and stirred the larger part of Europe. With a
crucifix in his hand, his body girdled with a rope,
clothed in a long cassock of the coarsest stuff, and a
hermit's hood, he could not have had, from the
standpoint of public attention, a better appearance.
He kept himself free from monkish evils in habits
and conduct, and as he preached the loftiest morality
by word as by life, the people honored holiness
in him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ready to
Preach
Anywhere</i></div>

<p>Like all who have been great reformers, he was
indifferent as to where he preached so that he could
get a hearing. When the pulpits were open and
could reach the multitude, he was glad to preach
in the sacred inclosures; when his mission could
reach more minds on the high roads and public
squares, he as gladly preached there. He knew
how to use apostrophes and personifications, and
made the holy places themselves clamor for help.
He sometimes showed a letter which he said had
fallen from heaven wherein God called upon all
Christendom to drive the heathens out of Jerusa<!-- Page 33 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>lem
and possess it forever. His favorite prophecy
was "Jerusalem shall be destroyed till the time of
the heathen shall be fulfilled." The agonies endured
by the Christians of Palestine he described
with such accuracy of language and appropriateness
of gesture, that his hearers seemed to see them
writhe under the lash and to hear them groan in
their wounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Waving his
Crucifix</i></div>

<p>When he had exhausted his vocabulary and was
exhausted by his emotions, he would wave the
image of Christ suffering on the cross before his
sobbing and wailing hearers.</p>

<p>The news of such preaching and of such scenes
travels fast and far. Wherever the Hermit went
he was received as a saint, and if the people could
not obtain a thread of his garment they contented
themselves with a hair from the tail of his mule!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Effect
of His
Preaching</i></div>

<p>Whatever the modern mind may see of credulity
among the people or of fanaticism in Peter, contemporary
annals show that his preaching was followed
by the results promised to the Gospel.
Michaud says: "Differences in families were
reconciled, the poor were comforted, the debauched
blushed at their errors. His discourses were repeated
by those who heard to those who did not.
His austerities and his miracles were widely known<!-- Page 34 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and credited. When Peter found those who had
been in Palestine, or confessed to have been there,
he used them as living examples, and made their
rags speak of the barbarities they had suffered, or
claimed to have suffered, at Turkish hands."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Constantinople
in Peril</i></div>

<p>Additional strength was given to the cry for relief
from Palestine by the perils of Constantinople.
This city, under nominally Christian emperors, had
become a museum of sacred relics. Alexius Comnena
threatened by the same warriors who had subjected
the Holy City, offered his sacred treasures
and his secular riches to the leaders who would
rescue his capital. The poor esteem in which the
haughty but, when in danger, servile Greek held
the Franks, as to everything but warlike power,
is indicated by his promising the Frank warriors
the beauty of the Greek women. As if these warriors
were of the same tastes as the Turks! To
pass under the Mussulman yoke was infinitely more
degrading than to hand his scepter to the Latins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Urban Concentrates
Opinion</i></div>

<p>Urban now found it a suitable time to attempt to
concentrate opinion and prepare for action by summoning
a Council at Plaisance. There was a great
response to the papal summons. Two hundred
bishops and archbishops, four thousand ecclesiastics,
thirty thousand of the laity came to the Council<!-- Page 35 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
which had to meet, on account of its size, outside
the city wall.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ambassadors
of
Alexius
Humble</i></div>

<p>The tone of the Eastern emperors had long been
so haughty that the presence of their ambassadors
at a Latin Council was a sufficient proof of their
humiliation. The pope seconded their requests and
prayers with all the force of speech and authority;
yet the Council concluded nothing. It seems probable
that the astute pope passed the word that no
conclusion should be formulated, as he was not yet
ready to indicate all that was in his mind. It may
well be that the danger to Constantinople was not
yet so evident to Alexius and to all as to indicate
the hour for absolute submission to the Roman authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Italy not
yet Roused</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Opening of
the Council</i></div>

<p>It is more probable, however, that Urban could
not yet command Italian aid and unity. Commerce
had so developed that religion, where it interfered
with it, could not command undivided allegiance.
The Italians, too, were near enough to know the
limitations of Urban's power, his failures and disgraces,
and could not be summoned to action as successfully
as those who were farther away from
knowledge of the weakness of the papal grip. So
the second Council met at Clermont in Auvergne,
and was equally weighty in the numbers attending<!-- Page 36 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and the authority represented. "The cities and villages
of the neighborhood were so filled that tents
and pavilions were erected in the meadows, although the
weather was very cold."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Various matters of Church and social discipline
were first considered and determined. The purposed
delay in reaching the real object of the
Council seemed to whet the appetites for the consideration
of the wrongs of the East. Enthusiasm
grew to fanaticism, and a grand and universal impatience
of other topics finally brought the greater
matter before the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Artful
Delay</i></div>

<p>The opening of the subject was had in the great
square before the cathedral. A throne had been
prepared there for the pope, who approached it
followed by his cardinals and accompanied by Peter
the Hermit in the garb now known to the Christian
world everywhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Describes
Sufferings
of Christians</i></div>

<p>Peter was put forward to speak first. His countenance
was cast down with humiliation, and his
voice expressed his inward agony as he told what
he had seen of the sufferings of Christians at the
scene of the world's redemption. He told how they
had been chained, beaten, harnessed like brutes;
how their bread had been taken away; how they
had been compelled to pay from the poverty of the<!-- Page 37 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
pilgrim's wallet for approach to the sacred shrines;
how Christian ministers had, like their Lord, known
the rod, and met their death.</p>

<p>It is not needful to suppose that the growth of
Peter's emotion, as he told this tale of horrors, was
simulated. In the cooler blood of to-day the narrative
stirs a sluggish heart. He ceased to speak because
choked with sobs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Urban's
Great
Speech</i></div>

<p>The speech of Urban, who followed Peter, was
one of the greatest ever spoken in its effect on the
history of the world. Delivered undoubtedly in
French, it survives only in ecclesiastical Latin. He
was in France. He wished to stir the French. He
could not have moved them through an interpreter
as he moved them in his own tongue and theirs. He
began in the language of compliment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Urban

<div class="sidenote"><i>Describes

<p>"Nation beloved of God, it is in your courage

I am well acquainted with your piety and
your bravery, I have crossed the Alps to preach
to you.... You have not forgotten that but
for the exploits of Charles Martel and Charlemagne
France would have been under the rule of Mahomet....
Your fathers saved the West from

are not stirred with shame and sorrow? The holy
place has become not only a den of thieves, but the
dwelling place of devils. Even the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher has become a stable for cattle. Men
have been massacred and women ravished within
those blessed walls. European Christians are warring
on each other when they ought to be rescuing
their brethren from the yoke, and from the unbeliever's
sword."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Offers Rewards

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pathetic

<div class="sidenote"><i>Further

<p>He appealed to every passion by captivating
prophecies. "The wealth of the unbelievers shall
be yours. You shall plunder their treasuries. Your
commander, Christ, will not permit you to want
bread or deny you a just reward. There is no crime
which may not be absolved by this act of obedience
to God. I offer absolutions for all sins; absolution
without penance to all who for this cause will take
up arms.... I promise eternal life to all who
die on the battle-field or on the way to it. The
crusader shall pass at once to Paradise. I myself
must stand aloof, but, like Moses, I will be fervently
and successfully praying while you are
slaughtering the Amalekites. I will not seek to dry<!-- Page 39 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the tears which images so painful for a Christian
and for the father of the faithful draw from you.
Let us weep over the sins which have withdrawn
the favor of God from us, but let us also weep over
the calamities of the Holy City. But if tears be
all, we shall leave the heritage of the Lord in the
hands of the wicked. How can we sleep in comfort
when the children of Jesus Christ live in torments?
Christian warriors, eager for pretexts to
unsheath your swords, rejoice that to-day you have
found a just cause for war. You mercenaries who
have hitherto sold your valor for money, go now
and merit an eternal reward.... If you must
have blood, bathe your sword in the blood of infidels.
Soldiers of Hell become soldiers of the living
God. Remember that 'he who loves father and
mother more than Me, is not worthy of Me.' Thus
speaks Christ to you to-day."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Spread of
Enthusiasm</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pardon by
Fighting</i></div>

<p>Long before this final sentence, Urban's hearers
had been lifted to indescribable enthusiasm. A
mighty shout as from a single throat answered him:
"God wills it. God wills it. We will join the army
of God!" Urban commands the bishops to rouse
their dioceses by preaching the instant duty of war
for the Holy Sepulcher. The enthusiasm spread
everywhere like an infection under ripe conditions.<!-- Page 40 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
France took the lead; Germany with slower step;
the Italians slowest of all, except the Normans who
dwelt among them. England contributed least of
all, the Normans being still busy in holding what
they had won, and Anglo-Saxons too discouraged
over their own defeats. Spain had her own anti-Mohammedan
battle to fight. Some noblemen, unable
to prevent their vassals from going, joined
them and took command that they might not wholly
lose their authority over them. Many had fought
notwithstanding papal prohibition. So many had
sins to expiate that they were happy that they
could find forgiveness while indulging their chief
passion, and could wash away their sins by shedding
blood.</p>

<p>Here again contemporary chronicles prove that
humanity is seldom governed by other than mixed
motives. Bishops who were also barons bore the
skill in warfare which they had gained in defending
their bishoprics in the Crusades. Some of the
priests, whose eyes were upon the rich bishoprics of
the East, found hope enlarged by arming for the
war. "Knights of God and Beauty" found a new
field in the march to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The distresses due to scanty harvests in 1094-95
contributed in some measure to the easy gath<!-- Page 41 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ering
of the hosts of the first crusade. Famine
seemed so close at hand that those who left their
homes had little to lose and much to gain. Nor
were the masses unwilling to fly from the oppressions
and exactions of rulers who claimed the
privilege to do wrong by Divine Right.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Normans
and Saracens</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Marvels
Begin</i></div>

<p>Apulia and Sicily had been wrested from the
Saracens by a few hundred Normans. This bred
confidence in the final result of the war. One of
the most curious of the fanaticisms, which developed
from the larger fanaticism, was that of the
sign of the cross in the flesh. Women and children
imprinted crosses on their limbs. A monk who
made a large cross on his forehead kept it from
healing and colored the gash with prepared juices.
He declared it was a miraculous stigma done by an
angel, and his lie served him well in abundant help.
It is further related that a company of Crusaders
being shipwrecked near Brundusium all the bodies
had a cross imprinted on their flesh just under
where the cross had been sewed on their clothes.
Perhaps they had done what the monk did; perhaps
poor dyes soaked through. A miracle was in those
days the easiest explanation of all marvels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>True Religion

<p>Yet all this was no more than the earth which
clings for awhile to all plants which spring from<!-- Page 42 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the soil. The essence of the movement as to the
masses was truly religious and the duties of religion
released the doer of "the will of God" from
all other obligations. The monk from his cloister
and the hermit from his cave declared they had
heard God's call.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sacrifices
for the
Cause</i></div>

<p>Men do not part with property for what they
do not deem a valuable consideration. Many at this
time surrendered their castles, their lands, their cottages,
to "leave all and follow Him." Small sums
sufficient to eke out the alms of the pilgrimage,
were accepted as pay, and, if not forthcoming, the
property was abandoned to him who might remain
to use it. It seemed as if all Europe was to emigrate
to Palestine.</p>

<p>The Crusaders have been ordered to march on
the Feast of the Assumption in the year following
the November of the Council. The whole winter
was given to preparation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Spring
Revives
Enthusiasm</i></div>

<p>The warmth of spring rekindled the fires of crusading
zeal, if indeed they anywhere burned more
slowly during the winter cold. Those who had
been at first indifferent to the movement now became
in large numbers as enthusiastic as those
first influenced. Both classes set out to the appointed
camping places. On horseback, in carts,
and on foot, the multitudes marched. Sin marched<!-- Page 43 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
with purity, and indulgence with penitence. Prostitutes
in arms appeared with the warrior and
dragged down many whom devotion sought to uplift.
Secular and warlike music was sometimes
overcome by psalms and other religious songs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Crazy
Enthusiasm</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ignorance
of the
Crusaders</i></div>

<p>More pitiful sights could be occasioned only by
a famine or pestilence. Men who had dependent
families were followed by the wives and children
who could not afford to be separated from their
natural protectors. Old men, helpless as to livelihood,
dragged after their strong-armed sons. There
was no joy over staying at home. Happiness
seemed to abide only with those who were going to
war. A stream starting from a village drew other
streams from the villages and towns through which
it passed until a river of humanity rushed on. They
did not know the length of their journey, and could
not conceive of the dangers they must approach and
pass. Some had been so steadfast in residence as
to have no idea of the size of the world even as it
was known to other men. Great lords with hounds
in front, and falcon on wrist, went out as if the
chief aim was to hunt and fish. All were crazed,
and at first no sane mind was left to point out the
dangers, or prepare a commissariat, or plan a campaign.<!-- Page 44 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE MARCH AND THE BATTLE.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Trace of
Common
Sense</i></div>

<p>There seems, at first, just one trace of common
sense, one semblance of a plan for the movement of
the hordes and mobs toward the Holy Land. Some
who had had a taste of war agreed that, as the
numbers were great enough for several armies,
they should not start at the same time nor traverse
the same route, and that the rallying-place should
be Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter
Chosen
General</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Monomaniac</i></div>

<p>Those who had followed Peter from place to
place, eager to be the first to start, chose the Hermit
for their general. It would seem as if Peter
had seen enough of war to know that his undisciplined
mob could meet but one fate. It is very
probable that he had become a monomaniac before
he began to preach the Crusade, and that, for the
greater part of his career, he had lost whatever balance
of judgment he had had. It is sometimes very
hard to distinguish between the unbalanced and the
enthusiast, between the enthusiast and the fanatic,
and between the fanatic and the monomaniac. Men<!-- Page 45 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
can certainly be sane on every point but one. Peter
in accepting the military command, passed the
bounds of reason. A monk might well think himself
called to preach on a great theme, to arouse
the nations to a great duty. He might easily and
properly feel himself competent to be the prophet
of God in denouncing the sluggish and the time-serving.
But to accept military command without
experience of war except as an observer, and to
lead an untrained and unprepared mob from Western
Europe to Palestine through difficulties of
which, as a pilgrim, he had had experience, connotes
insanity, or, at the best, "zeal without knowledge."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wore Old
Cassock</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Walter the
Penniless</i></div>

<p>He did not assume a new uniform. He wore
his old one. It was still his coarse woolen cassock,
his hood, his sandals, and his rope, and he rode the
same old mule with which his wanderings began.
His army was not less than eighty thousand strong.
But the camp followers were almost as many,
made up of old men, women, and children. Peter's
crazy faith promised food to all. They had joined
him from Northern France, and as he approached
Germany great numbers from Southern and Central
France swelled his ranks. A gleam of sense
appears in the division of his rabble into two bands,
one to be led by himself; the other by Walter the<!-- Page 46 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Penniless, who appears, from some points of view,
like a twin of Peter. Historians have little to say
of Walter's origin. Some say he was of gentle
birth and had exchanged his all for his title of
"Penniless;" others that Walter was not put in
command until his uncle died. The only certain
thing seems to be that his poverty and enthusiasm
were equal to those of his followers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>France
Helps
Crusaders</i></div>

<p>All goes well while the Crusaders march through
loyal and liberal France. Help was literally poured
into their laps; nor did the Germans, from the
earliest historic days easily touched by noble sentiments,
fail to respond both to the plea for the Holy
Land and for practical sympathy. The Rhine people
smoothed the pilgrims' way. They were, however,
to meet trouble on the banks of the Danube.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Western
Christendom
Disordered</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rumors of
Cannibalism</i></div>

<p>The expectation that the end of the world was
to come about the year 1000 was, for a century before
that date, well-nigh universal and dominant.
As that year approached the condition apparently
confirmed the prophetic warnings of the New Testament.
Western Christendom seemed to be hopelessly
disordered. It was at this time that a worse
invasion than that of the Turks threatened Europe.
The Magyars, or Huns, were barbarous, irresponsible,
undrilled, and rapacious; less responsible to
authority and less moved by pity than the Turks<!-- Page 47 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
had ever been. In their love for indiscriminate
massacre they seem to have been the wild Indians
of Europe. They came, nobody anticipating them,
nobody knowing from whence. Their ranks were
filled up and increased, nobody knew how. Rumors
of cannibalism preceded them, and they were believed
to be less than human in form and mind. A
Finn might have partly understood their talk, but,
to the people they attacked, their speech was gibberish.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Huns in
Europe</i></div>

<p>The weakness and divisions of Christendom invited
their approach and palsied resistance. At almost
the same date Bremen on the Baltic and Constance
on the lake, felt their power. They swarmed
over the Alps. They menaced Southern France,
and peered from the Pyrenees at Spain. Italy felt
their heaviest hand, and Rome saw their devastating
flames almost under its walls. For fifty years
Christendom quaked and fell before them, and
halted them for the first time in A. D. 936 by the
hands of Henry the Fowler. Gradually they were
restrained to the limits of modern Hungary, and
in the eleventh century they were Christianized and
the worst enemies of Christianity became guides
and caterers to the Crusaders, while not sharing
largely in their enthusiasms.<!-- Page 48 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Bulgarians</i></div>

<p>It was very different with the Bulgarians south
of the Danube over whose great plain of Sophia a
smoother path would be found if the Crusaders
could reach it. Sometimes protecting, sometimes
robbing Constantinople, their chiefs drank from the
gold-banded skull of a Byzantine emperor. Basil
conquered them only to show himself more barbarous
by putting out the eyes of fifteen thousand
Bulgarian captives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bulgarian
Allegiance</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Queer
Christianity</i></div>

<p>At the beginning of the Crusades Bulgaria was
nominally subject to the Greek Empire, but held
that authority in contempt. Heavy forests then
grew to the southern edge of the Danube where
now there are bare hills. This mingling of forest
and hill gave to the Bulgarians a security in self-rule
which was only, in general, ineffectively interrupted
by the army of the empire. The Bulgarian
type of Christianity did not extend the idea of
brotherhood beyond its own borders. They could
cheerfully make themselves, without the least
trouble of conscience, the terror of their Christian
brethren who were making their way to Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bulgars
Attack
Crusaders</i></div>

<p>The march, which began in piety and was conducted
for a time with due consideration for the
rights of others, soon, almost of necessity, became
a raid on the property of the people through whose<!-- Page 49 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
lands they passed. Bulgarian authority not being
able to supply provisions to Walter's army, they
foraged along their lines of march, and, when resisted,
burned houses and slew their inmates. The
Bulgars answered in kind; attacked the Crusaders
when loaded down with booty; penned some scores
of them in a church to which fire was promptly put,
and one hundred and forty were cremated. Walter
did not stop to attempt to revenge, but dragged after
him a starving and diminishing army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Crusaders
Learn
Something</i></div>

<p>The Governor of Nissa, moved by their condition,
refreshed them with food, warmed them with
clothing, and strengthened them with arms. Taught
by the Bulgarian lesson, they passed through
Thrace without thieving, and came at last, worn and
miserable, to the walls of Constantinople, where
Alexius permitted them to await the arrival of
Peter and his army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Brave
Follies</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Devastated
Country</i></div>

<p>Peter and his army passed safely through Germany,
but behaved worse and fared worse than
Walter and his following. The frontiers of Hungary
were decorated with the bodies of Crusaders
hanging at the gates of Semlin. Immediately Peter
ordered war. The people of the city fled to a hill,
with the Danube on one side and a forest on the
other. They were driven into the river, four thou<!-- Page 50 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>sand
being put to the sword. Belgrade first knew
of the battle by the corpses floating past her walls.
Naturally, on penetrating further into Bulgaria, the
Crusaders found only abandoned cities, food carried
away, and as much as was possible, the road
bereft of support of any kind. At Nissa they found
a well-fortified city, where Bulgarians looked down
from the walls on the Crusaders, and these last did
not dare to try their strength on such an obstacle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Great
Loss</i></div>

<p>At Nissa they seemed to have obtained supplies
and marched on. Some Germans paid off real or
fancied scores by burning some mills on the Nissava
River. The Nissans fell on Peter's rear guard,
killed all who fought, captured two thousand carriages
and many prisoners. Peter turned back immediately,
and flamed with wrath as he saw the
dead who lay near Nissa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Tart
Answer</i></div>

<p>Peter cooled down enough to send messengers
to the city and ask, on the ground of a common
Christianity, for the restoration of the prisoners and
spoil taken from the Crusaders. The governor of
the city tartly reminded the messengers that Christian
conduct alone proved men to be Christians, and
that the Crusaders having made the first attack, he
could only count them as enemies.</p>

<p>This answer fired the Crusaders to fight. Peter,<!-- Page 51 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
apparently growing in wisdom by experience, tried
to hold the warriors back and begged them to negotiate.
To wrath opposition is always treason, and
Peter found himself regarded as a coward and
placarded as a traitor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fighting
and Negotiations</i></div>

<p>While Peter was parleying with the Governor of
Nissa, two thousand Crusaders tried to scale the
city walls and carry the city by assault. The Bulgarians
drove them back. A general fight began
even while the two chiefs were negotiating. Peter
proved his courage by waving his crucifix between
the combatants and demanding that the fighting
should cease. The uproar of battle gave no heed
to his voice. His army was utterly routed and cut
to pieces. They had fought without command, and
were beaten into death and disorder. The Bulgarians
captured horses, equipages, the chest which
held the offerings of the faithful, and the women
and children. The greater skill and strength of
the Bulgars won the fight which the unreasoning
fury of Peter's followers had provoked.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Five
Hundred</i></div>

<p>On the top of a hill near by Peter bemoaned his
losses and, it is said, his foolhardiness. At that moment
but five hundred men answered his call. The
next day seven thousand who had been put to flight
rejoined him at the call of his trumpet. They<!-- Page 52 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
came in day by day until thirty thousand were mustered.
The rest had perished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Penitent
Rebels</i></div>

<p>The survivors had small stomach or ability for
fighting. They made their way toward Thrace in
a humble and peaceable frame, and seemed to feel
the mistake of rebellion against authority. Pity
came to their relief. Their thin bodies, their staggering
gait, their rags, and their tears brought
them the aid denied to their arms. None seemed
to have turned back. The combatants who were not
killed still kept their faces toward the Holy City.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Greek
Welcome</i></div>

<p>There seems good evidence that the Greeks
would have met them differently had they been less
helpless. The aversion of the Greeks to the Latins
had grown now for centuries. The Latins were
tolerable to the Greeks only when the Greeks needed
their aid. The Latins had arrived. For the present
they could do no harm. The emperor, Alexius, intending
to complain, sent messengers to Peter.
These returned with tales of weakness and suffering.
They were permitted to journey on, and,
with palms waving, came at last to Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter
Captivates
Alexius</i></div>

<p>Peter, an object of universal curiosity, if not of
admiration, had audience with the emperor, captivated
the monarch as he captivated all, and went
forth loaded with help for his army and some good<!-- Page 53 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
advice. This last was to the effect that Peter had
better await the arrival of the military princes and
generals who had pledged themselves to the Crusade.
But these, perhaps with calculated delay, lingered
at home while other bodies of Crusaders as
ill prepared, as troublesome, and as ill-fated as
those which had followed the lead of Peter,
marched away.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Roving
Crusaders</i></div>

<p>Two notable instances may be given. Gottschalk,
a German priest, had gathered fifteen thousand
Crusaders, who made him their leader. His
army arrived in Hungary near the end of summer.
Here they gave themselves up to every kind of
wrong-doing. They left behind them daily a trail
of outraged women, robbery, and arson. The
Germans were good fighters and checked the punitive
expeditions of the Hungarian ruler. What
was not possible to valor was accomplished by trickery.
The Crusaders admitted the Hungarian chiefs
to their camps and fraternized with them. They
yielded to promises and allowed themselves to be
disarmed. Promptly they were attacked and
slaughtered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Crusaders
Practice
on Jews</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Commerce
in Jewish
Hands</i></div>

<p>Incidentally the Jews suffered from the Crusading
craze. One band of rascally and ungovernable
Germans, who had many sins to be washed<!-- Page 54 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
away and who availed themselves of the hope for
absolution in the promise of the pope to those who
fought for the Holy Tomb, thought it ridiculous to
attack the Unitarian Mussulman so far away, when
the Unitarian Jew who had slain the Lord was
close at hand. Then, as now, the commerce of the
world was in Jewish hands, and it was felt that so
much wealth ought not to be in such hands. That
element which still exists in the Jewish character
of being purse-proud and offensively familiar in
prosperity, is reported to have twitted the Christians
with the worship of a Jewish prophet as a
God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Slaughter
of Jews</i></div>

<p>Whatever was the proportion of motive, it is
certain that this mob fell on the Jews and robbed
and killed all they found in the cities of the Rhine
and the Moselle. It is said that many perished by
kindling flames they felt to be more merciful than
their Christian persecutors. Others, with stones
tied to their necks, drowned themselves and their
treasures in the adjacent rivers. Let us be thankful
that there was pity somewhere and that the
Bishops of Worms, Treves, Mayence, and Spires
gave asylum to the persecuted race and denounced
the marauding bands as beyond the pale of the
Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Goose
for a
Leader</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fear
of such
Maniacs</i></div>

<p>This band set out for Jerusalem in pious rap<!-- Page 55 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ture
that the soldiers of God had been given victory
and had been supplied by the God of Battles
with money for the journey! Blinded with superstition,
they measure themselves to us by what they
did. Albert of Aix tells us that they found a goose
"filled with the Holy Ghost," which they made
leader in equal authority with a goat not less filled
with the same Spirit (<i>et capellam non minus eodem
repletam</i>)! Fear of such maniacs closed the gates
of Hungarian cities. The city now known among
Germans as Ungarish-Altenburg, situated in the
marshy embouchure of the Leytha, was attacked by
them by means of a causeway made of the trunks
of trees. Ladders were built, and walls, defended
by darts, arrows, and boiling oil, were almost scaled
and won, when the breaking of ladders caused a
panic and the plain was soon covered by fugitives
who had, like all panicky soldiers, thrown away
their arms. Multitudes of these were butchered
without resistance while others died hopelessly
mired in the marshes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Horrors
of the
March</i></div>

<p>Surely these are enough to show the horrors of
such marches in the name of Christ. A sentence
may express the fate of those who survived. The
Bulgarians almost finished what the Huns began.
The Greeks received the news with joy.<!-- Page 56 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Forget
Their
Lessons</i></div>

<p>At length Peter and Walter, between them,
could muster an army of one hundred thousand
men, when the re-enforcements from Italian cities
were counted. Still under the walls of Constantinople
it was not long before they forgot the lessons
of their defeats and began again to rob and murder.
Alexius soon found it expedient to ferry them
across the Bosporus. The subjects of Alexius suffered
worse than the Turks at first. Anna Comnena,
perhaps prejudiced, yet quoted by Michaud,
declares that the Normans in Peter's army when
near Nicea, chopped children to pieces, stuck others
on spits, and harried old people. The Germans,
stung by Norman gibes, took a fort in the mountain
near Nicea, killed the garrison and there met
the attack of the Turks only to be slain by the
sword. Their commander purchased his life by
apostasy and a treasonable oath.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Cruelties
of
Crusaders</i></div>

<p>Once again the army sets forward, against the
protest of the Penniless Walter, but by his forced
consent. Once again they meet the reward of ignorance
and undisciplined courage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Walter
Killed
at Nicea</i></div>

<p>The ruler of Nicea, concealing a part of his
army in the woods, waited for the Crusaders at
the foot of a hill. The Turks pretended flight, but
suddenly turned, surrounded the Crusaders on all<!-- Page 57 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
sides, routed them, and slew them with dreadful
carnage. Walter died of seven arrow wounds.
The whole army found refuge in a castle close to
the sea. The Chronicler says, "Their monument
was a heap of bones piled upon the plain of Nicea."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Turkish

<p>The two results in the East were intense prejudice

and contempt of the Turks for Christian warriors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Failure as
Leader</i></div>

<p>But where was Peter? Losing all authority
among the Crusaders he went back, before the battle
of Nicea, to Constantinople and turned the batteries
of his abusive eloquence on those he had lately
commanded. He called them robbers and brigands,
and said that their sins shut them out of the Holy
Land. In this he follows the sad habit of all, or
almost all, of those who lead their followers into
trouble. It is probable that he had at this moment
led three hundred thousand to death. It may be
that his conscience troubled him a little, though in
general the fanatic is superior to such pangs. At any
rate Peter calmed himself by the consideration that
his army was chiefly a rascally crowd. This was the
final proof that he was not of the stuff of which
leaders are made. The verdict of the historian is
just: "He had neither the prudence, the coolness,<!-- Page 58 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
nor the firmness of the commander." He could
rouse but not control. He could preach, but could
not conserve the results of his preaching. Hereafter
we shall see him as a preacher chiefly or in
kindred work. Others supply true leadership.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Later
Leadership
Wiser</i></div>

<p>Those who lingered at home, when the armies
of Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless
started for Jerusalem, may have been of the wiser
sort, and certainly seemed to have profited by the
calamities of their brethren, both in the matter of
preparation and in the treatment of the nations
through which they passed. The first army was led
by enthusiasm almost wholly. The second had
true military leadership.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christianity

With

Spirit</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Defects of

Christianity</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Europe
Callous as
to Losses</i></div>

<p>It is interesting to observe how the two great
dominant forces, Christianity and the military spirit,
co-operated, and even coalesced, yet allowed neither
to govern in its proper sphere. The early Crusaders
had piety enough to hold them to the march,
notwithstanding the awful trail of death. They
did not have enough to prevent their behaving on
the way more like devils than Christians. They
had sufficient military spirit to make them willing
to fight, but not enough to make adequate preparation.
The Christianity of that time had devotional
but not humanizing power. It carried along faith,<!-- Page 59 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
obedience to ceremonial, abundant prayers, personal
humility; but it had little restraint for passion
whether corporal or revengeful. Its hand was
powerless to restrain fury or prevent or relieve misery
"The knight before the battle was as devout
as the bishop; the bishop in the battle as ferocious
as the knight."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Little better fate availed the women
when Christians prevailed than when Turks won
the day. Whatever mourning there was for individuals,
the failure to win the Holy City appears to
have given more sorrow to Europe than the death
of three hundred thousand men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter
Ceases to
be General</i></div>

<p>One might gather up at this point the remaining
appearances of Peter, and call his work done.
But while he ceased to be a military leader, his work
continued, his spiritual influence remained. We
shall see him at one time arguing with Turks, and
at another praying for victory over them. His
strength and his weakness can only be brought out
by briefly sketching some of the men who took up
leadership after his failure, and with whose victories
he was identified as priest, prophet, and participant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Godfrey of
Bouillon</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Great
Character</i></div>

<p>The noblest, greatest of the leaders was Godfrey
of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Born<!-- Page 60 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in Brabant, the blood of Charlemagne was in his
veins through his mother. He had fought for the
antipope, and was the first to enter Rome when captured
by the army of Henry. His sentiments
changed until he was ready to expiate his sacrilege
by a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and as a warrior for
her deliverance. A giant in strength, a hero in
bravery, his simplicity was that of a hermit. He
was wise enough not to be reckless, and courageous
enough never to shrink from the supreme moment
of danger. The common soldier was his friend.
His word to all was his bond. Men felt braver and
safer under his lead. Others might seem by name
to be weightier than he in leadership, but in fact he
composed quarrels and compelled unity by his wisdom,
and, in moments of peril, what he thought prevailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Accessions
to His
Leadership</i></div>

<p>When his leadership was known, France and
the Rhine country gave him of their best in treasure,
of men, arms, and money. Women denied their
amiable vanities that their jewels might furnish
outfit for husbands and sons. The Abbe Guibert<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
declares that what avarice and war had hidden, now
came leaping in marvelous abundance into the
hands of the chiefs of the army. Heaps of gold<!-- Page 61 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
were visible in their tents, as if fruits had been
carried there instead of untold wealth. Yet some
robbed their vassals that they might be ready. Godfrey
sold his dominions chiefly to the bishops so
that it was well said that the secular princes stripped
themselves for the Crusaders while the bishops enriched
themselves by the enthusiasm of the laity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mixed
Motives
Again</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Godfrey
Welcome</i></div>

<p>Yet here again we must see mixed motives. To
regain Jerusalem was also to be enriched by Saracenic
spoils. To give up a petty government or
heritage in Europe might lead to dominion in Asia.
These things were promised by the authority of
pope and general. Many great names acceded to
Godfrey's roster, and aided in leading a fairly disciplined
and restrained army toward Palestine. The
Huns and Bulgars who had slain the hosts of Peter
welcomed the army of Godfrey, and sped them on
their way with food and prayers. He sent to the
East more than eighty thousand men. Their advance
made it easier for the pope to put the dominion
of unfriendly kings in peril by excommunications
and other ecclesiastical penalties. He trimmed
the talons of princes while their defenders were absent.
Papal authority rose as secular authority
went down. It gave the people peace at home at
the expense of national independence.<!-- Page 62 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fear of
Eclipse</i></div>

<p>How much science has done for humanity in
relieving it of evil signs and omens we may know
by this, that the reddened moon under eclipse and
the waving streamers of the Aurora combined to
persuade the people that the war was of God. The
indifferent were stirred by these prodigies, and
joined the Crusade, and Italy was moved as never
before. More princes, knights, and bishops than
can be recorded joined in the march. Alexius, the
craven emperor, who had invited Latin help,
trembled with good reason at the hundreds of thousands
now headed toward his capital. He was a
true Greek in sending ambassadors to greet them
and in hiding his troops where they could harass
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Confused
Tracks</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Mean
Emperor</i></div>

<p>No one can untangle the tracks of the many
bands as described by the annalists of each expedition.
Some went the ruggedest way; some the
smoothest. Alexius made a prisoner of a shipwrecked
count, only to have Godfrey shake him
into frenzies of fear by attacking one of his provinces.
He purchased allegiance from his prisoner
only to make himself and his prisoner objects of
contempt. He tried to starve Godfrey's army by
refusing provisions, only to have that army bring
the fear of famine to his capital through the energy<!-- Page 63 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with which it helped itself. The approach of Christmas
was used as a basis of peace. The foraging
ceased, and Alexius provided food.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christians
Quarreling</i></div>

<p>The spectacle of disagreement and of growing
contempt for each other is painful to any who this
day bear the Christian name. The Greeks had the
same contempt for the Latins which the Chinese
have for the foreign devil. Unable to resist their
arms, they took refuge in the futilities of philosophy
as their proof of superiority, and in the trickery
which, at some periods, had helped them well. But
nothing could meet or restrain the skill, courage,
and discipline of the forces pledged to the cross,
and no complacency was proof against the contempt
of the Latins for the Greeks, who, calling
themselves Christians, were indifferent to the cry
of the oppressed city of the Savior's passion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Alexius
Deceives
Godfrey</i></div>

<p>Alexius did succeed in blinding Godfrey, and
possibly Bohemond, who was coming toward Constantinople
through Macedonia. He obtained
pledges from both for the integrity of his empire,
and apparent submission. Alexius used money because
he could not use force, to create dissensions
and to win over the venial. His temporary success
would be astonishing were it not almost always the
case that the craft of an old civilization at first be<!-- Page 64 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>fools
the inexperience of more youthful, more
rugged, and more trusting nations. Alexius finally
got all to the other side of the Bosporus, but failed
to wheedle all who came near his throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>On the
Track of
Peter</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Crusaders'
Discipline</i></div>

<p>At this point, as the army marched through
Bulgaria, traces of Peter and his army begin to
appear. Refugees who had hidden in the woods
came to the camps in rags and emaciation. The
castle where Rinaldo sought refuge was pointed
out to the new comers as the tomb of all his companions.
The mountain at the foot of which Walter's
army had died was indicated with tears. The
site of the camp where Walter had left the women
and the sick, and which was captured by the Turks
at the supreme moment of the mass, only that the
venerable might be slain and the women and children
carried into slavery, roused the indignation of the
Crusaders beyond any other spot. It had one good
effect. In bringing on a much needed unity, it
brought also a discipline enforced by the calamities
whose evident cause was the lack of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Arrive at
Nicea</i></div>

<p>The spring brought the opportunity of battle to
the Crusaders, and a strong foe met them in the
person of the Turk David and his army. He had
fortified Nicea, a city famous for two Councils and
now the capital of David's kingdom. Nature de<!-- Page 65 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>fended
it by high mountains and a lake, and art by
walls, towers, and flooded ditches. Garrisoned by
the best of David's troops, one hundred thousand
more waited near by to their help. Five hundred
thousand foot-soldiers and one hundred thousand
horsemen came at length in sight of the city for the
first real battle of their Crusade against the infidel.
These, in camping before the city, divided their allotments
by walls piled from the bones of the Crusaders
who had fallen on that field. Nineteen languages
were heard in the camp, and each nation
fought as it would. Clash and clang soon came,
and the Turks, routed, fled to the hills, only to return
the next day and to be beaten a second time.
Three thousand Turkish heads were hurled by catapults
into the city by way of information.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Awful
Scenes</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bodies
Hurled

<p>The records paint an awful picture of the siege.
Whatever of mechanism or method was known to
Greeks or Romans was employed by besiegers and
besieged. Stones, fireballs, bunches of arrows,
heavy beams were fired into the city by ballista and
catapult, and were fired back with equal skill and
abundance. The battering-rams breached the wall
and found new walls rising just within. The besieged
fished with iron hooks from the top of the
walls, and hauled the captured Crusaders alive to<!-- Page 66 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
their death at the summit. Stripped, they were
used as stones for catapults, and stark naked were
fired back into the Christian camp. A Goliath
among the Saracens being killed, the Crusaders
were greatly heartened, and, having gained some
advantages, redoubled their attack. The enemy's
supplies by way of the lake were cut off, and their
resistance grew feebler. A tower was undermined,
and the thunder of its fall in the night alarmed both
Christians and Turks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Trick of
Alexius</i></div>

<p>After a siege of seven weeks, and when the city
was ready to fall, Alexius succeeded in putting his
emissary into the city, who persuaded the Turks
to surrender to him, and the besiegers found the
standard of Alexius floating from the walls. The
indignation of some was stayed by presents, and
craft brought Tancred to a slow oath of allegiance.
But the mass understood the treachery, and henceforth
good feeling between Latin and Greek was
impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Resumes
March</i></div>

<p>Resting awhile near Nicea, the Crusaders in two
bodies at length resumed their march through Asia
Minor. One was led by Godfrey, the other by
Bohemond and Tancred. Both were equally ignorant
of the perils of the mountains and of the
arid plains which were in their way. Bohemond's<!-- Page 67 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
army was surprised near a river by which they were
encamped. Wave after wave of Turks rolled over
them and were driven back. Their women were
captured by the Turks when they did not first prefer
death at their own hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bravery
of the
Leaders</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rout of
the Turks</i></div>

<p>The different leaders&mdash;Bohemond, Robert the
Duke of Normandy, Tancred, Richard of Salermo,
Stephen, Count of Blois&mdash;threw themselves into
the fight, drove the Turks back, but yielded ground,
through exhaustion, to fresh Turkish re-enforcements.
All seemed lost when Raymond and Godfrey
appeared with the other division of the Christian
army. These chased the Turks into the mountains,
flanked them on both sides, got into their rear,
and met them as they fled down the mountain. The
wearied ranks which had despaired had joined in
the charge. The Turks were routed; twenty thousand
fell on the field, and the enemy's camp fell
into Crusading hands. Returning to bury their
four thousand dead, they stripped off the Saracen
robes and swords and seem little less than barbarians
in their orgies of joy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pestilence
and
Famine</i></div>

<p>The Turks now gave up direct battle, and devastated
the country through which the Christians
must pass. Determined to separate no more, the
Crusaders became by their numbers more exposed<!-- Page 68 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to the dangers of pestilence and famine. Almost
all the horses perished in the desolated country. The
knights laden with armor found it impossible to
march, and some rode asses and oxen when they
could be found. The lowliest animals, even hogs
were made burden-bearers until these, too, perished
and left their loads to be wasted on the road. After
unmentionable horrors of birth and death, the army
was rescued by the finding of water by the dogs,
who, however, exposed by their finding it many incautious
drinkers to death from too quickly filling
themselves with water. The fair and fertile Pisidia
reached, the Crusaders were in comfort, plenty, and
peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Victory

<p>The news of their victories preceding them
opened the timid cities to their entrance, and
brought them abundant supplies. Brought into despair
by the apparent death of Raymond of Toulouse
and the serious wounding of Godfrey by a
bear, they rejoiced in the recovery of both as a
miracle in the camp.</p>

<p>How childish these and other giants in warfare
were, appeared by the breaking out of rivalries
and quarrels even in the face of the enemy.</p>

<p>A dreadful mountain passage where men must
march in single file, and where pack-horses were
crowded off precipices, introduces them at length
to Syria, within whose bounds the Palestine of their
desire was included. Antioch lay in their way, and
was besieged with many difficulties and dangers;
some from the presumption of a foolish faith;
others from the thoroughness with which supplies
had been destroyed by the Turks. Famine came
on through the lack of foresight, and pestilence
quickly followed. The winter rains inundated the
camps, and the dead in the general distress were
left unburied. The foraging parties could repulse
the Turks and even capture their camps, but could
not find within practicable range food enough for
the army. Their communications were cut off by
sea through the withdrawal of the Italian and Flemish
fleets, and the army settled down to abject misery,
despair, and death, as they heard that Swerro,
King of Denmark, with his promised bride and fifteen
hundred warriors, had been slain by the Turks
while marching to join the main army. Almost for
the first time soldiers began to desert, hopeless of
capturing Antioch or of reaching the Holy Land.<!-- Page 70 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter
Reappears</i></div>

<p>Peter the Hermit, who appears to have marched
silently with the army, now, of all men, shrinking
under the criticisms of the army, flees secretly from
the camp. They had lost the Duke of Normandy,
Tatius, William of Melun, by temporary or permanent
desertion, but the flight of Peter made the
most noise and caused the greatest scandal. He
was punished by Tancred and brought back in disgrace,
and was compelled to swear on the Bible that
he would never run away again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A
Wicked
Camp</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Remedy
for
Wickedness</i></div>

<p>Perhaps he ran from the awful wickedness of
the camp as well as from the famine and pestilence.
The soldiers, expecting soon to die, gave themselves
up to gambling, every phase of lust, and to
drunkenness, when the means thereof could be obtained.
A good element of the clergy, notably the
Bishop of Puy, by word and example sought to
stay the full flood of wickedness. It happened
then, as in every age, that a sign, something seen
of the eye, had more power than words addressed
to the conscience. An Aurora, a rare phenomenon
to most, was claimed by the preachers to be a warning
from God. Processions of penitents began to
march about the camp. Penalties for drunkenness
were devised, the hair being cut off in drunken
sleep. Blasphemers were branded. Turks and<!-- Page 71 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Syrians were spitted and roasted by Bohemond, who
thus rid the camp of unfriendly mouths and dangerous
spies. The good bishop who preached
against sin wrought practical godliness by compelling
the soldiers to plant the fields about Antioch.
This provided food and persuaded the Turks of the
indomitable spirit of the Crusaders. Provisions
began to come in greater abundance, and pestilence
was stayed by the opening of spring.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Egyptians
Seek Reliance
with
Crusaders</i></div>

<p>It is a curious fact that at this time an alliance,
wisely rejected for the most part, was sought by the
Egyptians with the Christians as against the Turks.
This condition would have put the Christians wholly
in the hands of the Caliph of Egypt the moment
the allied armies had possessed Jerusalem. The
spirits of the Crusaders were greatly raised by a
victory over twenty thousand Turks who came to
the relief of Antioch. Two thousand men and one
thousand horses were killed. The "gentleness" of
the Crusaders' conception of Christianity was shown
by loading two hundred Turkish heads on four
camels and sending them as a present to the departing
Egyptian envoys, and two hundred more
Turkish heads were thrown into the city of Antioch,
while many more were stuck on pikes around
the walls.<!-- Page 72 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Carlessness

<p>But they met disaster as well, because nothing
seemed to make them see the importance of discipline
and of precaution against surprise. Going
unarmed in great numbers to St. Simeon to bring
provisions from the Italian fleets, they were dispersed
by the Turks. Godfrey, whose great figure
is always seen when disaster is to be retrieved, follows
the Turks, heavy with their plunder, routs
them, and, having made wise disposition of troops,
prevents the retreating army from re-enforcing Antioch.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Slaughter

<div class="sidenote"><i>Details
of Valor</i></div>

<p>The besieged in Antioch witnessed the awful
battle from their walls, and the river Orontes
drowned two thousand who escaped from the Crusaders'
swords. A great picture of personal valor
is seen when, in hand-to-hand battle with a Saracen
leader, Robert of Normandy salutes him with
the words, "I devote thy impure soul to the powers
of hell," and splits his skull to the shoulders with a
single blow. Even a greater tale of ferocious
strength is told of Godfrey, who, when his shield
had been broken by a great Saracen, raised himself
on his stirrups and cut with such appalling
strength that one part of the Saracen remained on
the horse and the other fell to the ground. The
Mohammedans having buried most of their num<!-- Page 73 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>ber
who died near their walls in their arms and
robes, camp followers of Christian name dug them
up, stripped off all valuables, and paraded through
the Christian camps two thousand Turkish heads,
which were thrown, when the procession was over,
into the Orontes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An

Scoundrel</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Antioch
Taken by
Treachery</i></div>

<p>These details are surely enough to show the diabolical
cruelty with which the siege of Antioch was
carried on by both sides. The wily governor of
Antioch decrees a truce, and breaks it as soon as he
has provisioned the city. What would possibly
have been refused to arms was given, after seven
months' siege to policy and stratagem. Bohemond
found an Armenian, a renegade Christian, among
the commanders of the army of Antioch, managed
to meet him, and baited him with great promises.
The project to buy the way into the city was rejected
by the noble minds, but Bohemond took advantage
of the approach of a great Turkish army,
then only seven days distant, to fill the camp with
dread of surrender and of safety only in talk. Phirous,
the Armenian, had been well trained by Bohemond,
and offered to surrender his corner of the
city only to Bohemond. Fear of destruction brought
all the leaders to Bohemond's idea except Raymond.
The defenders of Antioch suspected treason through<!-- Page 74 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Phirous, and almost defeated the plans of that
scoundrel. But the renegade, keeping an inscrutable
face under question, and being dismissed with
praises, stabbed his own brother to the heart when
he refused to aid the traitorous plan, and in the
blackness of a night storm admitted one and another
by means of a leather ladder until there were
enough to take the city and put the surprised and
awakened Mussulmans to the sword. The morning
light showed the flag of Bohemond waving over
Antioch, but at the expense of six thousand defenders
dead.</p>

<p>Phirous received great wealth for his treachery;
followed the Crusaders to Jerusalem; remained
Christian for two years; then turned Mohammedan
again, and died detested and abhorred by Mohammedan
and Christian alike.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Attacked
by Egyptian
Army</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Famine
Once
More</i></div>

<p>The fall of Antioch was quickly followed by
new dangers for the Christians. The army whose
approach brought them to acquiesce in the treachery
of Phirous was soon at hand, and the Christians
were soon besieged in front of and within the city
they had just won. Famine once more was on them.
Horses were eaten first, and then hogs and dogs;
finally the leather of their boots and the corpses of
Saracens. The usual desertions followed, and star<!-- Page 75 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>vation
brought all the horrors of frenzy and blasphemy
from those who believed God ought to correct
human follies by miraculous power. Alexius,
who had begun a march to the relief of Antioch,
stopped when deserters told him the situation of the
Latins. Perhaps he was not ill-pleased over the
news.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Encouraged
by
Prodigies</i></div>

<p>The historians of the time say that the courage
of the Crusaders was revived through their superstitions.
At the moment of the greatest despair and
when the infidel general had refused their terms of
surrender, prodigies and visions came for their encouragement.
St. Ambrose, the Virgin, Jesus Himself,
were seen by some in the churches. The leaders
bound themselves anew by oath not to desert
the cause, and the army finally followed the example
of their captains. New wonders were reported
to confirm their resolve. A priest in his
sleep saw St. Andrew three times, who told him to
dig near the principal altar of St. Peter's church,
and he would find the head of the spear which
pierced the Redeemer's side. This should lead them
to victory. After three days of prayer twelve of the
clergy and knights dug in silence, and had gone
down twelve feet without avail. At night, when
the twelve witnesses were at prayers, Barthelmi<!-- Page 76 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
jumped into the hole and climbed out with the iron
in his hands!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter
Delivers
Challenge</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Boldness</i></div>

<p>Whether the Christian leaders felt that they
could better spare Peter than a general we do not
know, but we do know that, with the great revival
of courage, challenge was sent to the Saracens for
general engagement or single combat, and Peter the
Hermit was the messenger. He was in his element
when he could talk. Though treated contemptuously
by his audience, he spoke as if he was the
greatest ruler of the earth. It is a wonder that
they did not promptly kill him for his insolence.
He told them that Asia Minor properly belonged
to Christians, that God had permitted it to fall into
Turkish hands on account of Christian sins, but
God was now arisen to fight on the Christian side.
"Now," he says, "leave and go to your own country.
We will not humble you. We will pray for
your conversion to the true faith. If you will not
go, and will not become Christians, let us decide all
matters by battle by a few knights, or by one, or by
a general fight."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Embassy
Driven
Away</i></div>

<p>The perilous situation of the Christians was
known to Kerbogha, the Mohammedan general,
and he was enraged at the impudence of Peter. "You
are as good as conquered and come to me to dic<!-- Page 77 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>tate
terms. Go back and tell them they must receive
conditions, and not make them. If you will
acknowledge Mohammed, I will feed and clothe
you, and may leave Antioch in your hands. If not,
we shall see what the sword will do!" Peter and
his escort were driven off, and were several times
in danger of death on the way back. Battle was
ordered for the next day by the Christian captains.</p>

<p>During the night a hidden supply of provisions
was found. The Crusaders strengthened themselves
by a meal and the offices of religion, and day
coming, the Christian army, representing the twelve
apostles, marched out in twelve divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Carrying
the Lance-Head</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Disposition
for Battle</i></div>

<p>Raymond D'Agiles carried the lance-head and
fixed their attention on it. Some of the priests
chanted a warlike psalm in the front rank, while
others blessed the outgoing army from the walls.
The walls and the hills echoed the cry, "God wills
it! God wills it!" The appearance of the army
was such as to fill the Mussulmans with contempt.
Ragged, thin, and weak, mounted on asses and
camels, on anything which could carry them, they
deployed to meet the fifteen masses of Saracens.
The Crusaders soon cut to pieces the two thousand
who guarded the bridge of Antioch, and ranged
themselves where the mountain protected them from<!-- Page 78 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
surprise. The great names commanded the wings
and the center, with Bohemond in reserve. The
early hours were friendly to the Christians. Later
they were sorely hurt by a surprise from a body of
Saracens who had passed around the mountain and
had attacked their rear. The grass was fired in
front of the Christians by the sultan of Nicea, a fact
which was near ruining the prospects of the Christians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Prodigy of
Horsemen</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hundred

<p>Once again a prodigy is reported. A squadron
descends from the mountains, led by three white
horsemen. A bishop, perhaps himself the inventor
of this pious fraud, cries out to the wavering Crusaders:
"Behold, heavenly succor has come!" Instantly
the Christians revive and renew the attack,
and the Saracens were put to rout. Failing even to
rally on the other side of the river, they left behind
them their arms and their baggage. Their general
had only a small body-guard as he fled toward the
Euphrates. With horses captured on the field, the
Christians kept up the pursuit. A hundred thousand
of the infidels died, and four thousand Christians
won the martyr's crown. The battle enriched
the Crusaders beyond any hope or experience, and
Antioch was filled with the captured booty. The
historian declares, "Horrors had made the Christians
invincible. This was the only miracle."<!-- Page 79 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Disputes

Victory</i></div>

<p>With this astounding victory the march of the
Crusaders almost ceased to meet armed resistance.
The mass of the army clamored to march on to
Jerusalem. The leaders were divided. Some said,
"Let us march before the enemy recovers from the
terror of our arms." The majority of the leaders
forgot the Holy City in the pleasures, securities,
and conquests of Syria. This gave strength to
their arguments to wait for the re-enforcements of
men and horses for which they asked the home authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fifty Thousand

Pestilence</i></div>

<p>Pestilence was the penalty of delay, and fifty
thousand old and new warriors died in and near
Antioch. Yet in such times Christians could quarrel,
and Bohemond was denied by the Count of
Toulouse the full possession of Antioch. They
were ready to fight. Others followed their example,
and all important time was wasted by quarrels
and recriminations. At the very foot of the altar
some of the leaders lied and quarreled to gain
power. Bands roamed over Syria wherever there
was a chance to loot; fighting over it when taken,
and dying of starvation and thirst whenever they
met unexpected resistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Piety and
Villainy</i></div>

<p>The world has never seen a greater mixture of
piety and villainy than among these Crusaders.<!-- Page 80 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
They could rape, rob, and murder with a good conscience,
yet must be numbered among the most
heroic of men. They endured uncomplainingly long
marches in heat and cold, in hunger, thirst, and
pestilence. They fought superior numbers with
amazing courage. The one supreme virtue was
valor against man and beast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Excursions
While
Waiting</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Careless
Again</i></div>

<p>The long wait for orders to march to Jerusalem
sent some leaders out to take cities over which they
might rule, and others to visit the Christian leaders
who had already won thrones. But most remained
in a demoralizing inactivity until a prodigy of electrical
balls of light, or possibly a meteoric shower,
started, by various interpretations, the mass into securing
their rear by the capture and subjugation
of several Syrian cities. In one of these sieges the
Saracens threw something like Greek fire down on
the besiegers, and followed this with hives of bees.
Always the Crusaders seemed to be without a
proper preparation for food, and before more than
one city the Christian soldiers cooked and ate the
bodies of their enemies; and it is even reported that
human flesh was sold in the shambles of their camp,
as the flesh of dogs certainly was.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Saracens

<p>In all this horror the spirits of the Crusaders
were fortified by the outrages of the Saracens on<!-- Page 81 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the symbol of Christianity. They erected crosses
on their walls, covered them with filth, and reviled
the worshipers. It was poor policy for the besieged.
It infuriated the natural passions and inflamed the
religious zeal of the besiegers. Constructing engines
which shattered the walls, the Crusaders made
themselves masters of the fortifications. In the
dusk they did not dare to enter the city. In the
morning it appeared to be deserted, but the inhabitants
were discovered in subterranean refuges.
They were soon smoked out, and were slaughtered
without regard to age or sex. Thus fell the city of
Maarah, of which no stone was left. Awful as this
was for men wearing the cross of Christ, it spread
such terror that life may have been saved thereby,
since other cities willingly opened their gates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Soldiers

<p>The common soldiers refused longer to interest
themselves in the quarrels of their leaders, and,
hearing that the Egyptians had taken Jerusalem,
demanded to be led on, and threatened to choose
new leaders unless their old ones showed the way
to Jerusalem. Raymond finding that he must lead
or be left behind, forsook his ambition, led in a
procession of penitence, and gave the signal for departure.<!-- Page 82 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

traversed the territories of Syrian C&aelig;sarea, Hamath,
and Edessa. They were welcomed by Moslem
and Christian alike. Fear pleaded for this with
the first, and sympathy with the last. Protection
was sought at the hands of the invaders, and presents
and food were abundantly provided. They
were surprised and delighted by the return of Christian
prisoners believed to have perished on the battle-field.
A portion of the army reached Laodicea,
and welcomed there re-enforcements from England.
But the main object was still postponed, and the
army under separate leaders attacked neighboring
cities. Raymond sat down before Archas, and was
firmly resisted. Godfrey went to lay siege to Gibel,<!-- Page 83 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and Raymond of Turenne to Tortosa. This period
of delay and of excursions for the sake of loot, was
chiefly occupied by those who remained in camp,
with disgraceful quarrels when not engaged in inventing
miracles, and noising them abroad. The
first seem to have been largely checked by the appearance
of an ambassador from the Emperor Alexius
of Constantinople, who proved himself, while
professing friendship, about the worst enemy the
Crusaders had. Just now he reproached them with
gentleness, being afraid of them, for not putting
the cities they had captured under his dominion.
He promised to follow them with an army into
Jerusalem if the Crusaders would give him time
to prepare. Sick of his treacheries, and feeling
only contempt for him personally, his new complaints
and promises served only to cement and
unify them and make them the more ready to march
on. As to the miracles, they ceased when, in the
ordeal by fire, Barthelemi, the author of the Holy
Lance, came through the flames mortally injured.
The Caliph of Cairo, with whom it was believed
Alexius was in league, had already possessed himself
of Jerusalem, and, fearing for his authority
there, sent ambassadors to treat with the Christian
army. Rich presents were brought to the leaders<!-- Page 84 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
sufficient to tempt the avarice which had grown by
conquest. The announcement by the ambassadors
that the gates of Jerusalem would be opened only
to unarmed Christians&mdash;a proposition which the
leaders had rejected when in the miseries of the
siege of Antioch&mdash;enraged those in authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Crusaders'
Answer</i></div>

<p>The answer of the Christian leaders was an order
to prepare to march and a threat to carry the
war into Egypt itself. The Emir of Tripoli attacked
them with fearful loss, and was mulcted
heavily in tribute and provisions. All headed
toward Jerusalem with the way cleared by fear of
Christian arms, except Raymond, who was finally
compelled to march also by the threatened rebellion
of his soldiers. Late May found the Crusading
army in the field. They passed through a rich
country, whose harvests were finished and whose
orchards bore abundantly oranges, pomegranates,
and olives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Rich
Country</i></div>

<p>Yet as they marched they were mindful that
battle and pestilence had reduced their numbers by
two hundred thousand. Some had returned home,
unable to endure the hardships, and many had remained
in the conquered cities through which they
had passed. The army numbered scarcely fifty
thousand real soldiers. Yet much that was gone<!-- Page 85 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was a relief to their camp-chests and their commissary.
One historian thinks this fifty thousand
to have been really stronger than the horde which
besieged Nicea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Along
the
Sea Coasts</i></div>

<p>The line of march was along the seacoasts that
the sea might furnish them provisions through the
Flemish and Italian fleets. They reach Accon, the
modern Acre, to find the Emir promising everything
but immediate surrender, and that also when
Jerusalem was occupied. A wounded pigeon,
picked up by the Bishop of Apt, had under its wing
a letter from the Emir of Accon to the Emir of
C&aelig;sarea which said, "The accursed Christians have
just passed through my territories, and will soon
be in yours. Let the Mussulman rulers be warned,
and let our enemies be crushed!" The Crusaders
naturally believed this a providence of great assurance
and value, and presently moved inland and
took possession of Lydda and Ramla.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Near
Jerusalem</i></div>

<p>They were now but sixteen miles from Jerusalem.
A stronger desire to march on Egypt led
some to counsel delay. But agreement to march to
Jerusalem was had, and, with temporary desertions
and cautious advances and the marking houses and
towns as private possessions, they came at last near
Emmaus. Terrified by a lunar eclipse, some are<!-- Page 86 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
panic-stricken, but the phenomenon is well explained
and held to be a sign of victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jerusalem
from the
Hill</i></div>

<p>Now, those who slept that night could hope,
could know that, with the climbing of a hill, daylight
would reveal Jerusalem. On the 10th of June,
1099, the first who reached the summit at break of
day, cried out, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem," and the
crowd rushing after cried, "God wills it!" as they
looked upon the Mount of Olives and the Holy
City. Riders climbed down from their horses and
marched on foot; many knelt, and multitudes kissed
the ground. The sense of the sin for whose forgiveness
Christ had died, brought many to tears of
honest penitence and some to conscious pardon. As
they looked on the height where His profaned tomb
must be, they wept bitter tears and vowed again to
deliver the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Country
Laid
Waste</i></div>

<p>Before the Christians could invest the city its
ruler took care to ravage the adjacent territory,
poison the wells, and thus belted the walls with a
desert. He provisioned the city against a siege,
and fashioned all known engines of war. The garrison
of forty thousand was increased by twenty
thousand arm-bearing citizens.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Plan for
Attack</i></div>

<p>On the day after arrival, the various leaders distributed
the territory and laid siege to the city.<!-- Page 87 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Egress from the city was possible only through the
valley of Gihon and the valley of Jehoshaphat.
Christians from the city, driven out for fear of
treason and to burden the resources of the besiegers,
quickened the ardor of the Christian army by an
account of the wrongs they had suffered at Mussulman
hands. Churches had been robbed for the
benefit of infidel soldiers, and the most sacred buildings
were threatened with destruction by the unbelievers.
All these conditions led to a determination
of an early assault. They had made no adequate
provision for scaling walls or battering gates,
but expected Divine intervention in their favor.
The assault was repulsed, and their losses brought
the victory of reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Constructing
Engines
of War</i></div>

<p>Finding some large beams, they demolished
churches and houses to obtain other material. The
drought of summer came on; the cisterns had been
filled up or poisoned; Kedron ran dry, and thirst
added its horrors. The intermitting fountain of
Siloam was insufficient. The soldiers were reduced
to licking the dew from the stones. Animals died
in great numbers. The loot of great cities was exchanged
for a few draughts of foul water. Fear
alone prevented the sortie from the city which
would have nearly extinguished the Christian army.<!-- Page 88 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Some fled. The wonder is that so many remained
and saw that the only remedy for their evils lay in
the capture of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Aided by
German
Fleet</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Scarcity
of Water</i></div>

<p>As if a sudden gift from God, a German fleet
reached Jaffa. It was well unloaded before capture
by a Saracen fleet, and the detachment sent from
the besiegers to open communication, searched
Jaffa, and the provisions and instruments and material
for war were carried to the Crusaders' camp.
Desiring yet more, a native led the Duke of Normandy
to a forest thirty miles from the city, and
this timber was dragged to the city. Regular expeditions
to find water were successfully organized,
and lines of women and children quickly passed it
to the camp. Bunches of faggots were rapidly accumulated
and machines of war grew each day, and
were planted for the next attack. They made three
towers higher than the walls of the city, with a
draw-bridge, over which the besiegers might reach
the top of the walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Religious
Processions</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter's
Address</i></div>

<p>All being ready, they fortified their courage by
religious exercises, and with the clergy leading,
marched around the city. From the valley which
faces Calvary, the Crusaders set out, passing by the
reputed tomb of Mary, the Garden of Gethsemane,
and the Mount of Olives. They halted on the<!-- Page 89 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Mount of the Ascension to reconcile all differences
and seal pardon with mutual prayer. The Saracens
raised crosses on the walls, and denied them in
every way which could be devised by a foul imagination.
After a long silence, Peter the Hermit
once more finds voice: "You hear them! You hear
their threats and blasphemies! Christ dies again on
Calvary for your sins. Swear, swear to defend
them. The army of infidels will soon disappear.
The mosques shall be temples of the true God."
And much more did Peter say after his old eloquent
fashion, and with results which were wholly like
those which followed his early preaching. The
soldiers fell on each other's necks, praised God, and
pledged themselves to finish the holy work they had
begun. They passed the night after their return to
camp in prayer and in the reception of the holy
sacrament.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans spent their time also in exercises
of their religion, and thus both sides were
animated by the extreme of devout zeal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Saracen
Machines</i></div>

<p>The Christian leaders resolved to make the attack
before the courage of their army could diminish
by longer contemplation of the difficulties and
dangers of the assault. The Saracens had built up
their machines opposite those of the Christians, and<!-- Page 90 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to the last determined, as their mechanism seemed
more movable, to change their locality and attack at
a less prepared spot. During the night Godfrey
moved his quarters to the gate of Kedar. With
the greatest difficulty the tower on wheels and other
machines were moved. Tancred got his machines
ready between the gate of Damascus and the angular
tower known later as the Tower of Tancred.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Filling a
Ravine</i></div>

<p>A ravine which needed to be filled delayed Raymond,
who succeeded, by paying a small sum to
every one who would throw three stones, in building,
in three days, a good path across the ravine.
This done, the signal was given for a general attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Fight
Begins</i></div>

<p>The camp of the Christians was summoned to
arms by the trumpets on the 14th of July, 1099.
Men and machines began their awful task. The
air was full of flints hurled to the walls by ballistas
and mangonels. Under large shields and covered
galleries, the battering-rams approached the walls.
A cloud of arrows swept the ramparts, and the ladders
were erected at the most promising points.
Northeast and south the rolling towers were pushed
to the walls, and Godfrey set the example of being
first to open the battle from their tops. The resistance
was as vigorous as the attack. Arrows, spears,<!-- Page 91 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
boiling oil, Greek fire, and the missiles from the besieged
machines repulsed the attack. Through a
hole made by the besiegers the besieged attacked the
machines of the Christians, hoping to burn them.
Night came on after a twelve hours' fight without
victory to either side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Battle of
Second
Day</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Saracens
Attempt
to Burn
Towers</i></div>

<p>The next day, after a night spent in repairing
the attacking machines on the one hand and the
guardian walls on the other, the order to attack
was early given after heartening speeches by the
Christian leaders and tent-to-tent visitations by the
clergy. An Egyptian army was reported as approaching
and the report greatly encouraged the
besieged. The besiegers were infuriated by a damaging
resistance, whose strength and energy they
had underrated. The battle opened with a fierceness
unparalleled. Javelins, stones, and beams were
hurled in such numbers that some met in the air
and both fell on the besiegers. Flaming torches and
firepots were hurled from the walls. The Christian
towers did their work in the midst of flames,
particularly the Tower of Godfrey, on whose roof
a golden cross shone. The leaders fought amidst
piles of their dead and seemed to be invulnerable
themselves. Breaches were made in the walls behind
which stood a living barricade of Saracens.<!-- Page 92 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
An Egyptian emissary was caught, his message to
the besieged squeezed from him, and his body was
then hurled from a catapult into the city. The
wooden machines of the Christians began to burn,
as well as the battering-rams and their roofs, while
their guards and operators were crushed and
buried under their ruins. The attacking force was
fought to a standstill, and was reviled for their worship
of a helpless God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Inspiring
Vision</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Crusaders
Enter
City</i></div>

<p>A vision of a knight waving his buckler above
the Mount of Olives, and signaling that the Christians
should advance, renewed the attack. It is said
women and children defied all dangers, brought
food and helped push the towers against the walls.
Godfrey's Tower got near enough to lower its
gangway on the walls. Fire now came to the aid
of the Crusaders, being carried by a favoring wind
to the bags of hay, straw, and wool which made
the last inner defense. Godfrey, preceded by two
and followed by many, pursued the smoke-driven
enemy and entered the city. They killed as they
went. Tancred, encouraged by another apparition,
entered the city from another point; some through
a breach; others by ladders; others from the top
of the towers. The enemy at length fled, and the
cry heard first under Peter's preaching, "God wills<!-- Page 93 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
it!" was echoed in the streets of the Holy City.
While these were in the city, Raymond still met with
resistance which led them to abandon their tower
and machines, and to attack with the sword. They
scaled the walls by ladders, and were soon the victors.</p>

<p>The Saracens made a brave rally and charged
the Christians, who had already begun to pillage.
These were, however, soon led to victory by Everard
de Puysaie, and the infidels were finally routed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christians
Possess the
City on
Friday</i></div>

<p>Where prodigies are so constantly related and
truth sacrificed to marvels, we can not be certain
that the statement is true that the Christians entered
Jerusalem on a Friday at three, at the same
hour at which Christ died for all men. The Crusaders
forgot the teaching of the hour; remembered
only their wounds, losses, and sufferings, and put
to death without mercy all who came in their way
and all they could ferret out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christians
Murder
Saracens</i></div>

<p>Death by jumping from the walls seemed more
desirable to many than appeal to Christian mercy.
Their last resort was to the mosques, and particularly
the Mosque of Omar. Into this the Christians
rode on horseback and trampled the heaps of
dead and dying laid low by "Christian" swords.
An eyewitness, Raymond d'Agiles, says that in the<!-- Page 94 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
porch of this mosque blood rose to the knees and
bridles of the horses! Ten thousand were slain
there. The authority cited above declares that
bodies floated in the blood, and arms and hands
were tossed by sanguine waves. An Arabian author
says, "Seventy thousand were killed in the
Mosque of Omar." God alone knows the truth.
Only once before in human history can be found a
record of such slaughter, and that was when Titus
conquered the city centuries before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter
Object
of Great
Interest</i></div>

<p>The fame of Peter the Hermit was such that the
Christians of the city coming from their hiding-places
to greet their deliverers had no eyes for anybody
but the eloquent monk, nor praises for any
other. He was the sole cause of their deliverance
as he was the prophet of their cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Godfrey
Goes to
Holy
Sepulcher</i></div>

<p>The nobility of Godfrey appears in this, that,
refraining from revenge, as soon as the battle was
over he laid aside his weapons, bared his feet, and
went to pray at the Holy Sepulcher. This was the
signal for the cessation of bloodshed as soon as
known. The bloody garments were thrown aside,
and, barefooted and bareheaded, the Crusaders
marched to the Church of the Resurrection.</p>

<p>In this sudden change from fiends to the penitence
and devoutness of Christians, we note a con<!-- Page 95 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>stantly
recurring fact. These changes of mood
are characteristic of fanaticism, which is always
possessed by its ideas, and never rules over them.
Elijah stepped down from the exaltation of the
God-accepted prophet on Carmel to be the murderer
of the prophets of Baal, and was left to
cowardice, to melancholy, and to wandering in the
desert until taught by the fire, the wind, and the
earthquake that he was not to bring human passion
into God's work.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Crusaders
Again
Butcher
Saracens</i></div>

<p>The Crusaders seem to have learned no permanent
lesson of pity. They soon returned to the
sword. Fearing the care of too many prisoners;
dreading that, if released, they would have to fight
them again, and feeling that they must make ready
to meet an Egyptian army whose arrival was daily
expected, they decreed the death of all the unbelievers
who remained in the city. Passion energized
policy. They compelled the Saracens to leap from
the walls or into flames, and heaped up their corpses
as altars on which others were sacrificed. The city
was everywhere strewn with corpses, even, as one
remarks, "the very place where Christ forgave His
enemies." The habit of killing was now so inveterate
that such sights distressed none except as the
odors and dangers of pestilence. A few Mussul<!-- Page 96 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>mans,
saved chiefly from the fortress of David,
were compelled to remove for burial the bodies of
their kindred and people beyond the walls. The
soldiers of Raymond aided them, not from motives
of humanity, but because being the last to enter
the city, they hoped to secure what they had missed
in pillage by robbing the bodies of the dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Heaps of
Corpses</i></div>

<p>The city was soon cleaned, and, as all respected
the marks of private ownership upon which the
Crusaders had agreed, they were enriched and soon
contributed to the life of a most orderly city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Exhibition
of True
Cross</i></div>

<p>It will be recalled that when Heraclius conquered
Chosroes he claimed to have brought back
the true cross to Jerusalem. During the Saracenic
occupation the Christians had concealed it and now
brought it forth for the adoration of the faithful.
With triumph they bore it to the Church of the
Resurrection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Godfrey
Refuses
Crown</i></div>

<p>The question of government was settled, after
debate, fasting, some ceremony and prayer, by a
special Council of Ten. Godfrey of Bouillon was
chosen king with acclamation, all but universal, yet
he refused to receive a diadem because his Savior
had in that city worn a crown of thorns, and would
receive no other title beyond "Defender of the Holy
Sepulcher."</p>

<p>The effort to organize the Church admittedly<!-- Page 97 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
was less successful in putting wise and holy men in
high places than the attempt to elect a suitable king.
The bishops of the Latin Church, then as now, took
high ground, claimed to be above the civil power,
and demanded that the bulk of the captured wealth
be put into their hands. The Greek priests had the
right of possession, but were sacrificed. Simeon,
who had invited the Crusaders, and who from
Cypress had repeatedly sent the Latins succor, died
while a Latin bishop was claiming his patriarchate.
Arnold, believed by most to be tainted, was made
pastor of Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Arrogance

Bishops</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A New
Peril</i></div>

<p>The Saracens, much as they had suffered, were
not ready to abandon the field. Such as were left
joined the Caliph of Cairo who was advancing to
attack Jerusalem. Godfrey, deserted by some of his
colleagues, went out to meet him; the deserters following
after when the peril became more visible
and imminent. Peter led the clergy and prayed
for a final success. They numbered not more than
twenty thousand, yet they won a great victory,
some of their enemies being driven to the mountains,
others perishing in the sea. They dropped their
arms in terror, and were literally mowed down.
Thus ended the battle of Askalon, and it was the
last victory of the first Crusade.<!-- Page 98 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Peter
and His
End</i></div>

<p>Peter returned to Europe, resumed a quiet life
in a monastery, which was built at Huy on the right
bank of the Meuse, in pursuance of a vow made
when in danger at sea by Peter's fellow voyager,
the Count de Montaigne. It was dedicated in 1130.
Peter died there at a great age, and was buried at
his request outside the church on the ground of
humility. One hundred and thirty years later the
abbot removed (in 1242) his bones to a shrine before
the Altar of the Apostles in the Abbey Church.
His life was ended, "but his works followed him."</p>

<p>The church where he was buried was wasted
and wrecked during the French Revolution and
Peter's coffin destroyed. His gravestone still exists.</p>

<p>Other Crusades followed, of which mere mention
must suffice. Their results, however, in part
remain to this day, and deserve to be here recorded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greek
and
Latin
Church</i></div>

<p>As we have seen, the first Crusade had in the
minds of its originators, as at least a secondary object,
the reconciliation of the Greek and Latin
Church. But the result was directly opposite.
Their relations were submitted, and the gap is as
wide open to-day as then. The Saracens were less
dangerous to the Eastern Church and empire than
the Latins proved to be. The Latins conquered<!-- Page 99 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
for themselves. It must be admitted that the treachery
of Alexius gave large justification if not full
warrant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Power of
Papacy
Augmented</i></div>

<p>The strength and wealth of the papacy were
greatly increased. It attached all who went to its
authority by its dispensation, not only from purgatorial
pains but from the penalty of sin here and
hereafter. It made freemen of all who wore the
sign of the cross, and absolved from all allegiance
except to itself. By persuading departing lords to
make over their sovereignty to him, the pope became
the arbiter and consecrator of all sovereignty,
and at length obtained the right to release from allegiance
the subjects of two independent sovereigns.</p>

<p>No pope led an army. The shock of defeat to a
"Vicar of Christ" would have been very great. So
legates were sent and upheld in his name the supremacy
of the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Reasons
for Irrevocable
Vow</i></div>

<p>The vow to crusade was irrevocable, and sovereigns
took it to obtain pardon, to secure glory, and
propitiate favor. The pope alone could release the
votary, and he took good care to make the price
heavy in the acknowledgment of his authority.</p>

<p>By sending legates to every country to preach
the Crusades, the authority of the pope was also
greatly advertised and augmented. Through these<!-- Page 100 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the pope acquired a right to tax for his purposes
within the domain of independent States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How
Clergy
Grew
Rich</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Papal
Ambitions</i></div>

<p>The clergy and the Church grew rich because
unable to alienate their own estates, they bought in
the property and domains of princes, dukes, and
counts, who sold all to enter upon the Holy War.
For two centuries this went on among the most
fruitful of the many methods by which the Church
added to her temporal substance. The Church, by
the Crusade, established the principle that religious
wars were just, and for five centuries the principle
was indorsed with blood. Incidentally the hurling
back of the Mohammedan advance occurred, but
the hunger for papal dominion spurred on the popes
to bless those who fought. Called defensive at first,
they quickly became aggressive, and many a Crusading
band hacked at the Jews before carving a
path through to Mohammedans.</p>

<p>Chivalry took on a more religious tone through
the Crusades, if indeed it was not in some countries
directly born of the wars of the cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Principles
of
Chivalry</i></div>

<p>Most of the principles of chivalry were Christian
in the quality of conduct, if not always of motive.
To be just, generous, brave, the defender of
weakness, and to be pure in life were certainly
Christian duties. The Crusades gave a great field<!-- Page 101 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
for such virtues. But, alas! it was only to Christians
that these virtues were obligatory. The
knight often became a devil ranging over lands
wrested from Saracen control.</p>

<p>But respect for women, undoubtedly enhanced
by chivalry, took high ground in the reverence for
the Virgin, and, while it did not secure chastity,
gave some check to the master passion of the human
race.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Debt to
Arabic
Learning</i></div>

<p>And, finally, the Crusade, introduced the notation,
the science, the manufactures, and the medical
skill of the Arabs into Europe,&mdash;all of which aided
the coming of the light to the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Of all these results, Peter the Hermit was the
unconscious forerunner and prophet.</p>
